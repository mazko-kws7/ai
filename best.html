<h2 id="cro-usd"><a href="./CRO-USD.html">CRO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>
<li>While there’s potential for upward movement, the daily chart shows considerable volatility.

</ul>
<h2 id="dexe-usd"><a href="./DEXE-USD.html">DEXE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 65%</li>
<li>The overall trend from the last three months is bearish. Resistance around $14.20 in the hourly chart suggests a selling opportunity if the price approaches this level.</li>

<h2 id="ftn-usd"><a href="./FTN-USD.html">FTN-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
