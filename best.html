<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to the file system to read the actual files, I’ll provide a template for how I <em>would</em> respond, based on the information you’ve provided and the error message you received.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I will create hypothetical reports based on my knowledge of how they should look like.</li>
<li>The error message &quot;tail: cannot open ’response/<em>’ for reading: No such file or directory&quot; suggests that the script/process you were using to generate the reports failed. I will assume that </em>if* the files existed, they would have the format you described.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hypothetical Response Format (Because I cannot access real files):</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how I <em>would</em> provide the summary, sorted by take profit probability. I will generate 3 hypothetical report responses:</p>
<pre><code>Report Summaries (Sorted by Take Profit Probability):

*   **Asset:** HypotheticalAssetC
    **Probability:** 85%
    **Recommendation:** LONG
    **Entry:** 1.2500
    **Stop Loss:** 1.2450

*   **Asset:** HypotheticalAssetB
    **Probability:** 70%
    **Recommendation:** SHORT
    **Entry:** 150.50
    **Stop Loss:** 151.00

*   **Asset:** HypotheticalAssetA
    **Probability:** 60%
    **Recommendation:** LONG
    **Entry:** 50.00
    **Stop Loss:** 49.50</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Structure:</strong> The output is clearly structured with “Report Summaries” as the header and then each asset listed with its key information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sorting:</strong> The summaries are sorted in <em>descending</em> order of “Probability” (highest probability first).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Information:</strong> Each summary includes the “Asset” name and “Probability”, and other key information like Recommendation, Entry and Stop Loss.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Handling the Error:</strong> The initial error message <code>tail: cannot open &#39;response/*&#39; for reading: No such file or directory</code> indicates a problem with the script or process generating the reports. To fix this in a real situation, you would need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the <code>response/</code> directory exists.</li>
<li>Ensure that the script generating the <code>ASSET_NAME.md</code> files is running correctly and creating the files in the <code>response/</code> directory.</li>
<li>Verify the permissions on the <code>response/</code> directory and files allow the script to read them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In a Real Implementation:</strong></p>
<p>You would need a script (e.g., Python, Bash) to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>List Files:</strong> Use a function to get a list of all files matching the pattern <code>response/*.md</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Parse Files:</strong> For each file:
<ul>
<li>Read the contents of the <code>.md</code> file.</li>
<li>Use regular expressions or string parsing to extract the “ASSET_NAME”, “SHORT” or “LONG”, “entry price”, “stop loss”, and “profit probability” from the file content.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Store Data:</strong> Store the extracted data in a list of dictionaries or a similar data structure.</li>
<li><strong>Sort Data:</strong> Sort the list of dictionaries based on the “profit probability” in descending order.</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> Print the formatted summaries as shown in the example above.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong></p>
<p>I cannot execute any code or access external files. The above is a template for how I <em>would</em> respond <em>if</em> I had access to the files and the ability to process them. You’ll need to implement the actual file processing and parsing logic yourself. Let me know if you’d like help with a Python or Bash script to accomplish this, and I can provide code snippets (but you will still need to adapt them to your specific file structure and system).</p>
