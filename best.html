<ul>
<li>Sell 85%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows limited upward momentum, and the recent news regarding geopolitical tensions and profit-taking in risk assets suggests a potential short-term decline. The low volume in the hourly chart also indicates a lack of strong buying interest.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="ftn-usd"><a href="./FTN-USD.html">FTN-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 65%</li>
<li>The decreasing volume on the daily chart suggests weakening bullish momentum. The consolidation in the hourly chart could also indicate indecision, and a break <em>below</em> the support level could lead to a sell-off. Some sources show a “Sell” rating for FTN [7]. Unfavorable global economic conditions or geopolitical tensions could trigger a decline.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gt-usd"><a href="./GT-USD.html">GT-USD</a></h2>
