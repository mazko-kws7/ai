<li><p><strong>BNB-USD:</strong> Here is the potential trade setup: If the trade is short, the take profit should be on 57420, what means: if the price goes at 62420 there is 60% chance that will continue decreasing and reach 57420 Take Profit probability: 60%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CFX-USD:</strong> A short trade with 40% take profit, and stop loss on 56235, to ensure the profit.

<li><p><strong>HBAR-USD:</strong> I suggest you look for a short opportunity on 0.72 - 0.74 , with 0.076 stop loss level, and 0.60 take profit level , resulting on a higher take profit opportunity: 40% and 55% stop loss oportunity. Take Profit Probability: 55%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>INJ-USD:</strong> Here is one potential trade setup: I will set to short, setting the stop loss at 34000, and take profit to 30000 as a conservative approach, and to 25000 as an aggressive target. In this case if the price touch stop loss, there is 60 % probability that will continue the increment and a lower opportunity of 40% to make a take profit (conservative way). The higher probability is to loose the investment if a high is reached, or to secure only part of the investmen if the market value grows. Take Profit Probability: 55%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>KSM-USD:</strong> I recommend a short position, given the indicators previously analyzed, what makes a 35 probability the order does reach the stop loss level and 65% to make a take profit. If this trade to happen, I recommend entering the short position on 11600, stop loss to 11840 and take profit to 10770. Take Profit Probability: 65%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LDO-USD:</strong> In conclusion a trade could be potentially open, if the stop to short indicator is strong, on 2.7 value , with a 60% probability that you order makes a take profit. Take Profit Probability: 60%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LINK-USD:</strong> If the data is followed by the recommendation, I would recommend to set it to short, with a higher take profit probability - of almost 60% and a reduced probability of stop loss, close to 40%, what indicates to put in first position to reduce risk. Take Profit Probability: 60%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NEAR-USD:</strong> After considering a bit the volatility and external indicator for today’s trend, I recommend to open a short position, and to configure take profit at a higher point of 58%, what is still a high probability to reach stop loss point by now Take Profit Probability: 58%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PEOPLE-USD:</strong> I recommend to open a short position, what will generate a higher probability of around 60% to make a take profit and only 40% to loose your investment. For more information, it would help to know, what are the odds or recent trends. Take Profit Probability: 60%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>POL-USD:</strong> The indicator that has followed these data is that they are a 40% opportunity to hit the stop loss, and 60% of having positive results on a take profit, if and only if the order is set up as previously explained. Take Profit Probability: 60%.</p></li>

Take Profit Probability: 65%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>THETA-USD:</strong> Given the data and the technical analysis done previously, I recommend a short trade, with 65% of reaching a take profit, and 35% stop loss. Take Profit Probability: 65%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TON-USD:</strong> To conclude, the recommendation for trading is Short, with a high take profit configuration, of approximately 70% value, and 30% loss. Take Profit Probability: 70%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TRX-USD:</strong> The recommendation is LONG and the probability is for approximately: 60% opportunity for take profit and 40% for stop loss. Take Profit Probability: 60%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>VET-USD:</strong> After all these considerations and recommendations, and the current information for the market, I consider that the potential is for: 56% of the orders to be with take profit, and a minor opportunity of 46% of stop loss, Take Profit Probability: 56%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>XDC-USD:</strong> In conclusion, with this set of data, and based on all of the previously explanation, the probability is on setting the chart is 60% probability to touch the take profit versus 40 probability to touch the stop loss. Take Profit Probability: 60%.</p></li>

<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s concerning how many responses are overly confident in their “probability assessment” despite the disclaimers about limited data and the inherent unpredictability of the market. Many of the probabilities are stated as 60% or higher, which is unrealistic for a short-term trade based on limited information.</li>
<li>Some responses misunderstood the prompt and provided a probability that <em>the probability assessment itself was accurate</em>. That’s not what I was asking for. The probability assessment should be the AI’s <em>estimate of the likelihood of the trade being profitable</em>.</li>
<li>A few responses had conflicting data. I took the final listed probability in those cases.</li>
<li>The responses marked as “Unclear or Lacking Specific Probability” either omitted the probability assessment entirely or provided a range that was too broad to be useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>This curated summary should be a helpful resource for comparing these AI trade ideas. Remember to always DYOR and never blindly follow any trading advice!</p>
