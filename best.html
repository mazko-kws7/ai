<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to the files on your system, I will act as if I <em>do</em> and provide you with the output format I <em>would</em> give you, based on the information you’ve provided. I will assume the files exist and contain the necessary information.</p>
<p>Here’s the output I will generate, assuming I’ve parsed the <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files and extracted the trading information:</p>
<pre><code>**Trading Recommendations Sorted by Take Profit Probability**

(Assuming I found data in the reports similar to the examples below.  The asset names and probabilities are placeholders.)

*   **Asset: AssetD (Probability: 55%)**:  Based on the report, this asset has a 55% probability of reaching its take profit target.

*   **Asset: AssetA (Probability: 65%)**:  Based on the report, this asset has a 65% probability of reaching its take profit target.

*   **Asset: AssetC (Probability: 70%)**:  Based on the report, this asset has a 70% probability of reaching its take profit target.

*   **Asset: AssetB (Probability: 80%)**:  Based on the report, this asset has an 80% probability of reaching its take profit target.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation of the Output:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sorted by Probability:</strong> The list is sorted in <em>ascending</em> order of the “Probability” value (lowest to highest).</li>
<li><strong>Asset Name:</strong> <code>Asset: ASSET_NAME</code> shows the name extracted from the filename.</li>
<li><strong>Probability:</strong> <code>(Probability: XX%)</code> shows the take profit probability extracted from the report content.</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> A brief description indicating that the probability is related to the take profit target.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (since I cannot access your files):</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>File Format and Content:</strong> My ability to extract the correct information <em>entirely</em> depends on the consistent format and content of your <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files. If the files have varying formats, or if the “probability” is presented in different ways, I’ll need more specific instructions on how to parse them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error Handling:</strong> If any file is missing or has an unexpected format, I’ll ideally need to be informed. The <code>tail</code> error suggests there is no such directory or it is unaccessible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing Information:</strong> If a file is missing the “probability” value, it should probably be excluded from the summary (or perhaps listed at the very end with a note indicating missing data).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To get a <em>real</em> summary, you’ll need to write a script (e.g., in Python) that reads these files, extracts the required information, and sorts the results accordingly. If you provide sample contents of your <code>.md</code> files, I can create the script for you, but please be aware that I cannot execute the code without access to your local machine.</p>
