<p>Okay, I understand. Since you are unable to provide the report data directly, I will give you the structure of how I would respond <em>if</em> you were able to provide the files. The response will assume I have successfully read each file.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how I would proceed:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Assume Report Structure:</strong> I will assume each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file contains text like this (but potentially more information):</p>
<pre><code># Trading Recommendation for ASSET_NAME

Recommendation: LONG  (or SHORT)
Entry Price:  150.25
Stop Loss: 149.50
Take Profit: 152.00
Profit Probability: 65%</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Processing Logic (What <em>would</em> happen if you could provide files):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read File:</strong> For each file <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>, I would attempt to open and read its contents.</li>
<li><strong>Extract Information:</strong> I would use regular expressions or simple string parsing to extract the:
<ul>
<li><code>ASSET_NAME</code> from the filename.</li>
<li>Trading <code>Recommendation</code> (LONG or SHORT).</li>
<li><code>Profit Probability</code> (as a number).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Output Format (The desired output, sorted by probability):</strong></p>
<p>I would create a list of summaries, then sort it numerically by <code>Profit Probability</code> in <em>descending</em> order (highest probability first). The final output would be formatted like this:</p>
<pre><code>Summary of Trading Recommendations (Sorted by Profit Probability):

- Asset: [ASSET_NAME_1], Recommendation: [LONG/SHORT], Probability: [PROBABILITY_1]%
- Asset: [ASSET_NAME_2], Recommendation: [LONG/SHORT], Probability: [PROBABILITY_2]%
- Asset: [ASSET_NAME_3], Recommendation: [LONG/SHORT], Probability: [PROBABILITY_3]%
... and so on, in descending order of probability.</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example - if you <em>could</em> provide data:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say you had these files (imagine I read them):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>response/AAPL.md</code>: Recommendation: LONG, Probability: 70%</li>
<li><code>response/GOOG.md</code>: Recommendation: SHORT, Probability: 60%</li>
<li><code>response/MSFT.md</code>: Recommendation: LONG, Probability: 85%</li>
<li><code>response/TSLA.md</code>: Recommendation: SHORT, Probability: 75%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then the response would be:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Summary of Trading Recommendations (Sorted by Profit Probability):

- Asset: MSFT, Recommendation: LONG, Probability: 85%
- Asset: TSLA, Recommendation: SHORT, Probability: 75%
- Asset: AAPL, Recommendation: LONG, Probability: 70%
- Asset: GOOG, Recommendation: SHORT, Probability: 60%</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important - Due to the “No such file or directory” error, <em>I cannot actually do this</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What you need to do:</strong></p>
<p>The <code>tail: cannot open &#39;response/*&#39; for reading: No such file or directory</code> error indicates that either:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The files <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> don’t exist in the location where you’re running your script/command.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The user running the command doesn’t have read permissions for those files or the <code>response</code> directory.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To get a real response, you need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make sure the files are actually there in a directory named <code>response</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure the user you are running the script as has permission to read the files.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the content of each report file one by one so I can process them.</li>
</ol>
