<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to the files themselves and you’re getting a “No such file or directory” error (which suggests the files aren’t actually present), I’ll give you a general template response based on the information you’ve provided.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file contains information in a format I can reasonably extract: Trading Position (LONG/SHORT), Entry Price, Stop Loss, and Profit Probability.</li>
<li>I will make up sample data for this example.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Response:</strong></p>
<p>Since I can’t read the actual files, here’s how I would format the output, <strong>assuming</strong> I could extract the necessary information. I’ll invent some data for illustrative purposes.</p>
<pre><code>**Trading Recommendation Summaries (Sorted by Profit Probability):**

*   **Asset: AssetD - Profit Probability: 55%**
    *   Position: LONG
    *   Entry Price: 15.50
    *   Stop Loss: 15.00

*   **Asset: AssetB - Profit Probability: 65%**
    *   Position: SHORT
    *   Entry Price: 100.20
    *   Stop Loss: 101.00

*   **Asset: AssetA - Profit Probability: 70%**
    *   Position: LONG
    *   Entry Price: 50.75
    *   Stop Loss: 50.00

*   **Asset: AssetC - Profit Probability: 80%**
    *   Position: SHORT
    *   Entry Price: 25.10
    *   Stop Loss: 25.50</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Asset:</strong> The <code>ASSET_NAME</code> extracted from the filename (e.g., <code>response/AAPL.md</code> would have <code>Asset: AAPL</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Profit Probability:</strong> The profit probability value extracted from the file content.</li>
<li><strong>Sorting:</strong> The list is sorted in <em>ascending</em> order of <code>Profit Probability</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Notes &amp; What You Need To Do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Access:</strong> The most important thing is to ensure that the files <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> actually exist in a location that the process/script you are using can access. The “No such file or directory” error is the key problem to resolve. Double-check the file paths and make sure the program has the necessary permissions to read them.</li>
<li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> You will need a script (e.g., in Python) to:
<ul>
<li>List the files matching the <code>response/*.md</code> pattern.</li>
<li>Open each file and read its content.</li>
<li>Parse the content to extract the trading position, entry price, stop loss, and profit probability. This is the trickiest part and depends on the format of the data <em>inside</em> the files. You might use regular expressions or other parsing techniques.</li>
<li>Store the extracted information in a data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries).</li>
<li>Sort the list based on the profit probability.</li>
<li>Print the formatted output as shown in the example above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>File Content Format:</strong> Provide more details about the exact format of the data <em>inside</em> the <code>.md</code> files if you want me to create the code snippet for data extraction. For example: “Each file contains a line like ‘Profit Probability: 75%’” or “The file is a JSON document with a key called ‘profit_probability’”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you can access the files and describe the data format within them, I can help you create a more specific script to perform the analysis you require.</p>
