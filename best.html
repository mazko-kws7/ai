<p>Okay, I understand the situation. Even though you’re getting a &quot;tail: cannot open ’response/*’ for reading: No such file or directory&quot; error (which indicates that the script or process you’re using is trying to access files that don’t exist in a directory named “response”), I can still provide a general response based on the instructions you’ve given.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions (since I don’t have the actual report content):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file contains text that includes:
<ul>
<li>A trading position recommendation (e.g., “LONG”, “SHORT”)</li>
<li>An entry price (e.g., “Entry Price: 100.50”)</li>
<li>A stop loss (e.g., “Stop Loss: 99.00”)</li>
<li>A profit probability (e.g., “Profit Probability: 75%”)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Response (Without Actual File Content):</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Okay, I’m ready to process the reports. If you provide the content of each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> report, I will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Extract the Asset Name:</strong> Identify the <code>ASSET_NAME</code> from the filename (e.g., if the file is <code>response/AAPL.md</code>, the asset name is <code>AAPL</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Extract the Trading Position:</strong> Find the recommendation (LONG or SHORT).</li>
<li><strong>Extract the Profit Probability:</strong> Find the profit probability (e.g., 75%).</li>
<li><strong>Create a Summary:</strong> Form a short summary line for each report including the asset name and probability.</li>
<li><strong>Sort by Probability:</strong> Order the summaries from highest profit probability to lowest.</li>
<li><strong>Present the Sorted Summaries.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example of how the output <em>would</em> look, if I had the data:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say you provided the content of three files and after parsing, it looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>response/AAPL.md</code>: Recommendation: LONG, Profit Probability: 85%</li>
<li><code>response/GOOG.md</code>: Recommendation: SHORT, Profit Probability: 60%</li>
<li><code>response/MSFT.md</code>: Recommendation: LONG, Profit Probability: 70%</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the output would be:</p>
<pre><code>AAPL: 85%
MSFT: 70%
GOOG: 60%</code></pre>
<p><strong>How to provide the data to me:</strong></p>
<p>Since I cannot access your files directly, you need to provide the content of each report individually. You can copy and paste the text from each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file into our conversation, one at a time. Please make sure to clearly indicate which asset each report belongs to (e.g., “AAPL Report:”, followed by the content of <code>response/AAPL.md</code>). Once I have all the reports, I’ll generate the sorted summary. &quot;</p>
