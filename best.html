</ul>
<h2 id="arb-usd"><a href="./ARB-USD.html">ARB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Mixed technical signals and upcoming token unlock event may create downward pressure. Resistance around $0.48 - $0.50 may hold, leading to a pullback.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atom-usd"><a href="./ATOM-USD.html">ATOM-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Given the recent decline and mixed sentiment, a sell signal might be appropriate for those holding ATOM, especially if the price fails to break above $4.35 in the short term.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="avax-usd"><a href="./AVAX-USD.html">AVAX-USD</a></h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="bch-usd"><a href="./BCH-USD.html">BCH-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The RSI is approaching overbought territory. If BCH fails to break above the $600 resistance level, a pullback is possible. Volumes, while increased recently, are still not at levels seen in previous rallies, indicating a lack of strong conviction from the broader market.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ada-usd"><a href="./ADA-USD.html">ADA-USD</a></h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="act-usd"><a href="./ACT-USD.html">ACT-USD</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>
<li>The FIL-USD price has been in a downtrend over the past three months, and recent data suggests it is trading below its 50-day moving average. A potential bearish MACD crossover may signal further downside. General negative market sentiment could exacerbate the decline.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cfx-usd"><a href="./CFX-USD.html">CFX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>
<li>CFX’s heavy regulatory alignment with China exposes it to unpredictable risks, as the country’s crypto policies remain restrictive and subject to abrupt change. Any negative regulatory moves could quickly erode access, trading volumes, and developer activity, limiting long-term upside.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="algo-usd"><a href="./ALGO-USD.html">ALGO-USD</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="dexe-usd"><a href="./DEXE-USD.html">DEXE-USD</a></h2>
