</ul>
<h2 id="bgb-usd"><a href="./BGB-USD.html">BGB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Short-term hourly chart shows a downward trend. The price is currently around $4.36-$4.45, and recent news indicates a slight underperformance against the broader crypto market [15, 16, 20].</li>

<h2 id="avax-usd"><a href="./AVAX-USD.html">AVAX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>

<h2 id="bch-usd-1"><a href="./BCH-USD.html">BCH-USD</a></h2>
