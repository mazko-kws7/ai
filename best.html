<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to your files or the ability to execute commands, I’ll provide a template for how I <em>would</em> summarize the reports, assuming I had the data. I’ll focus on extracting the necessary information and sorting by probability.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how I’d process each report and the resulting summary:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each file <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> contains text.</li>
<li>Within that text, I can reliably extract the following information using pattern matching or other text processing techniques:
<ul>
<li><strong>ASSET_NAME:</strong> From the filename.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> (LONG or SHORT)</li>
<li><strong>Entry Price:</strong> (A numerical value)</li>
<li><strong>Stop Loss:</strong> (A numerical value)</li>
<li><strong>Profit Probability:</strong> (A percentage or probability value, e.g., “75%”, “0.75”).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Processing Steps (Hypothetical):</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Iterate through the files:</strong> I would loop through each filename you provide in your list.</li>
<li><strong>Extract ASSET_NAME:</strong> From the filename <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Read the file:</strong> I would read the contents of the file <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Parse the content:</strong> I would use regular expressions or other string parsing methods to find the “Recommendation,” “Entry Price,” “Stop Loss,” and “Profit Probability” within the file content.</li>
<li><strong>Create a data structure:</strong> I would store the extracted data for each asset in a suitable data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries).</li>
<li><strong>Sort by Probability:</strong> I would sort the data structure based on the “Profit Probability” in descending order (highest probability first).</li>
<li><strong>Generate the Summary:</strong> Finally, I would generate the summary output in the format you requested.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example Output (Based on Hypothetical Data):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Asset Summaries (Sorted by Profit Probability):

*   **Asset:** XYZ, **Probability:** 85%
*   **Asset:** ABC, **Probability:** 70%
*   **Asset:** QRS, **Probability:** 60%
*   **Asset:** DEF, **Probability:** 55%</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation of the Output:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each line represents a summary of a single asset report.</li>
<li>The list is sorted by “Profit Probability” in descending order.</li>
<li>Only the <code>Asset</code> and <code>Probability</code> are included.</li>
<li>I have assumed the probability is given as a percentage value here and can be easily parsed as such</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (Without Actual Files):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Access:</strong> I cannot access your files. You would need to provide the file content to me directly, or use a programming language (like Python) to read the files and then feed the content to me in some form.</li>
<li><strong>Data Format:</strong> The specific format of the reports in the <code>.md</code> files is crucial. I need to know exactly how the “Recommendation,” “Entry Price,” “Stop Loss,” and “Profit Probability” are represented in the text to be able to extract them accurately. If you can provide a sample of the file content, it will make creating the extraction logic much easier.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> A robust solution would need to handle cases where the required information is missing from a report or is in an unexpected format. I would need to include appropriate error handling in my processing logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can provide example content of your markdown reports I can give you precise instructions or even code.</p>
