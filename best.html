<li>Sell 50%</li>
<li>I got some search results that are not related to today as “The provided data and search results are from October 4, 2025, and should not be considered financial advice. Cryptocurrency investments are highly speculative and carry significant risk. It looks like you got results from previous runs -”Please regenerate again&quot;&quot; I apologize for the error regarding XLM-USD. You’re right; that response retained information from previous interactions, which I shouldn’t have done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, let’s generate corrected signals for XLM-USD, focusing exclusively on the provided chart data and without referencing past or external information, with the same structure as before. Due to the inability to calculate indicators, I will make high-level inferences based on visual inspection.</p>
<p>Here’s the revised XLM-USD analysis:</p>
<p><strong>Revised Analysis of XLM-USD</strong></p>
<p>Based solely on the provided daily and hourly chart data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily Chart (Last Three Months):</strong>
<ul>
<li>The daily chart shows a volatile price history over the past three months. The price has experienced some periods of sharp increases followed by declines, suggesting a lack of sustained momentum.</li>
<li>Recent price action indicates consolidation within a narrower range.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hourly Chart (Last Five Days):</strong>
<ul>
<li>The hourly chart shows short-term price fluctuations, with no clear upward or downward trend. The price appears to be moving sideways.</li>
<li>There’s a lack of strong volume on the hourly chart, suggesting a lack of strong buying or selling pressure.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inferred Technical Indicators:</strong></p>
<p>Since I cannot perform calculations, I will infer the likely direction of the following indicators based on visual analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moving Averages:</strong> Short-term MAs (e.g., 20-day) might be trending sideways, reflecting the lack of a clear trend.</li>
<li><strong>RSI:</strong> Might be oscillating around the neutral level (50), reflecting indecision.</li>

<li><strong>Relevant Data:</strong> Hypothetical resistance level at $0.42, increased volume during the breakout.</li>
