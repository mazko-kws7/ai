<ul>
<li>Sell 55%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows struggles to break significantly above $4.20. If there is a belief that downward pressure will continue in the short term, a small short position could be considered.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="avax-usd"><a href="./AVAX-USD.html">AVAX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The overall trend appears to be upward, and the hypothetical 20-day SMA suggests the price is trading above its recent average. If the price retraces to a support level around 23-24 it <em>could</em> represent a buying opportunity, assuming the broader market sentiment remains positive (which I can’t confirm).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aave-usd-1"><a href="./AAVE-USD.html">AAVE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>Despite the recent price decline, Aave has strong fundamentals, including the upcoming V4 upgrade and growing GHO stablecoin adoption [7, 8]. The price is near the $255-$250 support zone, which could provide stability [8]. Some indicators are approaching oversold conditions [8].</li>

<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>If BNB price drops to the $930 - $940 demand zone, this could present a buying opportunity, assuming it holds. The broader trend for BNB is still considered bullish.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="btc-usd"><a href="./BTC-USD.html">BTC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>Bitcoin often experiences corrections before continuing upward trends. The long-term trend remains positive, and dips can be buying opportunities. Furthermore, the fixed supply of Bitcoin makes it resistant to inflation [10].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cro-usd"><a href="./CRO-USD.html">CRO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>Analyst Javon Marks sees room for a big move, with a target of $0.8868. The partnership with Trump Media and the potential for a $6.4 billion CRO treasury could provide future demand. A breakout of a descending wedge can attract volume.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dexe-usd"><a href="./DEXE-USD.html">DEXE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The daily chart shows DEXE-USD has corrected from its recent highs and is showing signs of stabilization around the $7 level.

</ul>
<h2 id="act-usd"><a href="./ACT-USD.html">ACT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 40%</li>
<li>The price is near a potential support level ($0.032-$0.034), and the RSI on the hourly chart might indicate oversold conditions. However, the overall market trend is bearish, making this a high-risk trade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dot-usd"><a href="./DOT-USD.html">DOT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>DOT is approaching oversold conditions, and there is potential for a short-term rebound. The Polkadot 2.0 upgrade could attract new investment. This signal is highly speculative and carries significant risk.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enau-usd"><a href="./ENAU-USD.html">ENAU-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>ENA has found a short-term foothold above $0.57, supported by the recent $20M investment news. Tightening Bollinger Bands and sustained institutional inflows suggest a potential breakout.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="eos-usd"><a href="./EOS-USD.html">EOS-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The recent price consolidation in the hourly chart, combined with the news of Trump-backed investment, suggests a <em>potential</em> for a short-term upward movement. Note that the USDT unsupport news could offset this.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bgb-usd"><a href="./BGB-USD.html">BGB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>Recent price consolidation in the hourly chart suggests potential stabilization. If overall market sentiment improves, BGB-USD could see a relief bounce. Oversold conditions based on the daily chart’s sharp drops could also support a buy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="avax-usd-1"><a href="./AVAX-USD.html">AVAX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The overall trend appears to be upward, and the hypothetical 20-day SMA suggests the price is trading above its recent average.

</ul>
<h2 id="fil-usd"><a href="./FIL-USD.html">FIL-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 55%</li>
<li>Triple bottom pattern identified on the weekly chart suggests a potential reversal. MACD curling for a bullish cross. However, overall trend remains bearish, so this is a counter-trend trade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ksm-usd"><a href="./KSM-USD.html">KSM-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 55%</li>
<li>The price is near the $13.00-$14.00 support level, and the overall “Fear” in the market sometimes precedes a short-term bounce. However, the hourly chart is unreliable due to missing volume data, and the general trend seems downward. This would be a contrarian trade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ena-usd-1"><a href="./ENA-USD.html">ENA-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>ENA has found a short-term foothold above $0.57, supported by the recent $20M investment news. Tightening Bollinger Bands and sustained institutional inflows suggest a potential breakout.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="eth-usd"><a href="./ETH-USD.html">ETH-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>ETH has pulled back, potentially creating a buying opportunity. Ethereum has crossed the 4,000 USDT benchmark with a 3.05% increase in 24 hours [9]. A strong GDP growth often leads to increased trader confidence, potentially driving more capital into both traditional and crypto markets [3].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="algo-usd-1"><a href="./ALGO-USD.html">ALGO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 65%</li>

<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>ONDO has pulled back from recent highs and is showing signs of stabilization around the $0.90 level. The overall trend is still upward on the daily chart. A bounce from this level, coupled with positive momentum indicators (e.g., RSI moving up from oversold territory), could signal a buying opportunity. News regarding tokenized U.S. treasuries being available on the XRP Ledger can positively affect the price.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="op-usd"><a href="./OP-USD.html">OP-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The daily chart shows OP-USD has declined over the last few days, potentially reaching an oversold condition. The hourly chart shows some consolidation around $0.67. If the broader market stabilizes, a short-term rebound is possible. A contrarian indicator is social media users anticipating lower prices, which historically can increase the likelihood of a price rebound [13].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="doge-usd-1"><a href="./DOGE-USD.html">DOGE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="dot-usd-1"><a href="./DOT-USD.html">DOT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="etc-usd-1"><a href="./ETC-USD.html">ETC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The daily chart still shows an overall upward trend. The current pullback may be a temporary correction. If the price reaches a strong support level (e.g., around 20.5 or 19.8) and RSI indicates oversold conditions, it could present a buying opportunity for a potential bounce. Ethereum Classic’s PoW consensus mechanism and fixed monetary policy are unique attributes [9].</li>
