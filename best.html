<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to the actual files or the content within them, I will provide a template response based on the information you’ve given me. I will assume the reports exist in the format you’ve described and provide a structured output that you can then manually fill in with the data extracted from your reports.</p>
<p>Here’s the template response, sorted by (assumed) Take Profit Probability:</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> You will need to manually open each file (<code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>), extract the Asset Name, Take Profit Probability, and then fill in the table below. I am providing example probabilities and asset names to illustrate the format, you will need to replace them with the actual values.</p>
<pre><code>**Trading Position Recommendation Summary (Sorted by Take Profit Probability)**

| Asset Name | Trading Recommendation (LONG/SHORT) | Entry Price | Stop Loss | Take Profit Probability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ExampleAssetC | SHORT | 1.25 | 1.26 | 60% |
| ExampleAssetB | LONG | 150.00 | 149.50 | 75% |
| ExampleAssetA | LONG | 0.80 | 0.79 | 85% |

**Instructions:**

1.  **Replace `ExampleAssetA`, `ExampleAssetB`, `ExampleAssetC` with the actual `ASSET_NAME` from your reports (e.g., `AAPL`, `BTCUSD`, `EURUSD`).**
2.  **Open each `response/ASSET_NAME.md` file.**
3.  **Extract the Trading Recommendation (LONG or SHORT).**
4.  **Extract the Entry Price.**
5.  **Extract the Stop Loss.**
6.  **Extract the Take Profit Probability (as a percentage).**
7.  **Populate the table above with the extracted data.**
8.  **Re-sort the table by the &quot;Take Profit Probability&quot; column in *descending* order (highest probability at the top).**

**Explanation:**

This response provides a clear, sortable summary of your trading recommendations. The &quot;Take Profit Probability&quot; is the key sorting factor, allowing you to quickly identify the potentially most profitable trades based on the probabilities outlined in your reports.  Remember that this is just a tool, and you should always conduct your own due diligence before making any trading decisions.</code></pre>
<p><strong>How to Use:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Copy and paste the template above into a text editor.</li>
<li>Open each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file one at a time.</li>
<li>Fill in the table with the data from each file.</li>
<li>Once the table is complete, sort it by the “Take Profit Probability” column (highest to lowest).</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach provides a manual method to achieve the result you requested, given the constraints of not being able to access or process the actual files. Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
