<h2 id="apt-usd"><a href="./APT-USD.html">APT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The price is facing resistance around $6.00. Given the fluctuating price history, it might be a good time to reduce holdings. Further more, over $50M worth of APT tokens were unlocked starting on 12th April which could create selling pressure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ena-usd"><a href="./ENA-USD.html">ENA-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The short-term technical analysis indicates bearish momentum. ENA is showing signs of exhaustion after a recent peak. A failed retest of the $0.31–$0.32 zone suggests buyers are weakening and sellers are gradually dominating.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atom-usd"><a href="./ATOM-USD.html">ATOM-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The daily chart suggests a continuing downtrend, and multiple sources indicate bearish sentiment for ATOM in the short term. The price has struggled to break above $5.00. Although there are signs of institutional interest, it hasn’t translated into sustained upward price action.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="arb-usd"><a href="./ARB-USD.html">ARB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
<li>The short-term trend (4-hour chart) appears bearish, with sellers maintaining pressure. The price is struggling to break above $0.34.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="algo-usd"><a href="./ALGO-USD.html">ALGO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
<li>If the short-term buy signal fails to materialize and the price breaks below recent lows, it could indicate further downward pressure. Lingering bearish sentiment and resistance levels suggest limited upward potential.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ada-usd"><a href="./ADA-USD.html">ADA-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
<li>Despite the bullish signals, ADA has struggled to maintain upward momentum consistently. If it fails to break the $0.74 resistance and macroeconomic factors introduce uncertainty, a pullback is possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="etc-usd"><a href="./ETC-USD.html">ETC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>If ETC breaks below the $16.50 support level, it could signal further downside. The daily chart shows a downtrend.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bgb-usd"><a href="./BGB-USD.html">BGB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 75%</li>
<li>BGB’s value is tied to the Bitget exchange. The exchange is expanding and integrating both CeFi and DeFi. The limited supply of BGB and its use for discounts and exclusive access within the Bitget ecosystem is a positive long-term factor. Regulatory approval from El Salvador’s Central Reserve Bank is another positive signal. Price predictions for BGB vary, with some expecting it to reach $10.09 in 2025 and $22.10 by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bch-usd"><a href="./BCH-USD.html">BCH-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>While there’s short-term upward potential, BCH has been in a consolidation phase for a while. Overall macro economic situation is uncertain due to tariffs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ftn-usd"><a href="./FTN-USD.html">FTN-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>
<li>FTN-USD price is facing resistance and unable to breakout. If there are any global events this could cause the sell confidence level to increase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="eos-usd"><a href="./EOS-USD.html">EOS-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>
<li>Given the recent address poisoning attacks on the EOS network and general volatility, a short-term pullback is possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="doge-usd"><a href="./DOGE-USD.html">DOGE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Price is struggling to break resistance levels, and technical indicators show mixed signals. Risk of market correction and volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fil-usd"><a href="./FIL-USD.html">FIL-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The overall trend on the daily chart appears downward. If holding FIL from a significantly higher price, consider reducing your position to protect capital. Some sources suggests that FIL price may drop to $2.61 by the end of the week.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="algo-usd-1"><a href="./ALGO-USD.html">ALGO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows recent stability, and the daily chart indicates a potential bottoming out. Positive news regarding Algorand’s scalability could act as a catalyst. Recent reports from April 2025 show potential for ALGO to reach 0.30 to 0.42 in a bullish scenario.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="avax-usd"><a href="./AVAX-USD.html">AVAX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Negative news (hypothetical) regarding increased regulation of AVAX could lead to a price decline.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="btc-usd"><a href="./BTC-USD.html">BTC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Based on the daily chart, the recent price action shows some consolidation with a potential for a short-term pullback. While the long-term trend might be upwards, the 5-day hourly chart shows indecision. Several hourly candles indicate high price rejection.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cfx-usd"><a href="./CFX-USD.html">CFX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>
<li>The price has generally declined over the last three months, and the 200 day moving average has been sloping down since late April.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fet-usd"><a href="./FET-USD.html">FET-USD</a></h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="aave-usd"><a href="./AAVE-USD.html">AAVE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>The price has consolidated around 173 USD.

<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>A golden cross has formed, and the price is approaching a critical resistance level of $0.74. Positive community sentiment and the increasing likelihood of a Cardano ETF could drive the price higher if the resistance is broken.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="inj-usd"><a href="./INJ-USD.html">INJ-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The longer-term downtrend in the daily chart and concerns about a crypto winter suggest further price declines are possible. The price is facing resistance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cro-usd"><a href="./CRO-USD.html">CRO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>If CRO drops below $0.085 due to negative sentiment, it could present a buying opportunity. This is based on the daily chart indicating previous support levels. However, this is a risky move, as the reissuing of tokens could drive prices lower.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The price has significantly dropped over the last three months, <em>potentially</em> approaching a bottom. If the RSI on the daily chart reaches oversold conditions soon and the broader crypto market shows a bullish reversal, this could be a speculative buying opportunity. Additionally, the positive outlook for cryptocurrency market growth to USD 4 billion by 2028 could add value to the coin as well.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="ena-usd-1"><a href="./ENA-USD.html">ENA-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>If ENA price invalidates this structure by reclaiming $0.30, the path of least resistance remains downward.
