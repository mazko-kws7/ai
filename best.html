<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>
<li>BGB has recently declined. Given the potential for a continued downtrend, consider selling a portion of holdings if the price fails to break above $4.70 and MACD histogram shows convergence.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ftn-usd"><a href="./FTN-USD.html">FTN-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>
<li>The daily chart shows a significant price drop, and simulated technical indicators (RSI and MACD) suggest continued downward pressure. Although the circulating supply of FTN is already high which may cushion the impact of sell-offs, a recent token unlock could spark volatility [13].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dexe-usd"><a href="./DEXE-USD.html">DEXE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Recent price decline, bearish trend in the last month, and negative market sentiment. DEXE is down -41.10% in the last month [13]. The overall crypto market is shrinking [9, 14].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="eos-usd"><a href="./EOS-USD.html">EOS-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The overall trend from the daily chart is strongly bearish. Although there might be short-term bounces, the prevailing sentiment is negative. The price hitting resistance around $0.30 in the hourly chart further validates a sell signal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="avax-usd"><a href="./AVAX-USD.html">AVAX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The short-term downtrend in the hourly chart, combined with bearish signals from technical indicators (MACD crossover, negative BBP), suggests continued selling pressure. Recent news also indicates potential further losses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="btc-usd"><a href="./BTC-USD.html">BTC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Price is consolidating near resistance, bearish sentiment, and trading below key moving averages. Escalating US-China trade tensions add to downward pressure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cfx-usd"><a href="./CFX-USD.html">CFX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
<li>The daily chart shows a downtrend, and the price is below key moving averages. Negative market sentiment and potential regulatory concerns could pressure the price.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apt-usd"><a href="./APT-USD.html">APT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
<li>The daily chart shows a longer-term downtrend. If the price fails to break above resistance around $4.00 and the overall market weakens, a sell signal may be warranted.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="arb-usd"><a href="./ARB-USD.html">ARB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="doge-usd"><a href="./DOGE-USD.html">DOGE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>
<li>Dogecoin’s history of volatility and reliance on social media hype makes it vulnerable to sharp declines [3, 5, 20]. If the price fails to break above the resistance level mentioned above ($0.20 - $0.21), and bearish signals appear (e.g., bearish MACD crossover, RSI entering overbought territory), a sell signal could be considered. The lack of a hard cap on Dogecoin’s supply can also dilute its value over time [20]. Several technical indicators suggest a sell trend [1, 3, 9, 10].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ada-usd"><a href="./ADA-USD.html">ADA-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Hold 70%</li>

<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows relative stability and the daily chart shows signs of recovery from a low. If the price breaks above the $0.37 level (hourly), it could signal a short-term upward trend. The overall sentiment for Jupiter is bullish.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stx-usd"><a href="./STX-USD.html">STX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>STX is showing signs of recovery after a flash crash, with the RSI stabilizing. Positive news around partnerships and institutional investment could drive prices up. If $STX holds above $0.455, further gains toward $0.50 are likely [12].</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="avax-usd-1"><a href="./AVAX-USD.html">AVAX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="doge-usd-1"><a href="./DOGE-USD.html">DOGE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The recent price consolidation on the daily chart, combined with some analysts predicting a rebound after a downturn [11], suggests a potential short-term buying opportunity. The hourly chart shows some upward movement recently. A trader on X (formerly Twitter) predicts a “quiet, calm, determined” rebound, noting that DOGE is trading at historically low momentum and the RSI suggests it is in a historical bottom zone [11]. The RSI, if near oversold levels based on <em>current</em> real-time data, would further support this signal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dot-usd"><a href="./DOT-USD.html">DOT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>The price has pulled back from recent highs, and the hourly chart shows signs of potential stabilization. News of ETF inflows suggests continued institutional interest. A break above a key resistance level on the hourly chart could signal a further upward move.</li>

<li>The daily chart shows the price has declined, potentially reaching an oversold condition. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is not available with the data provided, so this is speculative.

</ul>
<h2 id="hbar-usd"><a href="./HBAR-USD.html">HBAR-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>Despite the current bearish sentiment, HBAR has strong enterprise adoption and potential for long-term growth. If the altcoin breaks above the flag’s upper boundary, the next target ranges between $1.60 and $1.80.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hype-usd"><a href="./HYPE-USD.html">HYPE-USD</a></h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="kas-usd"><a href="./KAS-USD.html">KAS-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
