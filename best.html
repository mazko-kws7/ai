<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to the actual files and received an error message, I’ll provide a template response.</p>
<p><strong>Assuming I had access to the content of each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file and that I can extract the relevant information, the output would look like this:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Note: The probabilities and asset names are placeholders. The actual order would depend on the data in your actual files.)</strong></p>
<pre><code>Summary of Trading Recommendations (Sorted by Take Profit Probability):

*   **Asset:** ZZZZ (Probability: 60%) - [Describe the trade recommendation - e.g., &quot;Long position recommended with entry at X, stop loss at Y.&quot;]
*   **Asset:** AAAA (Probability: 70%) - [Describe the trade recommendation - e.g., &quot;Short position recommended with entry at X, stop loss at Y.&quot;]
*   **Asset:** CCCC (Probability: 75%) - [Describe the trade recommendation - e.g., &quot;Long position recommended with entry at X, stop loss at Y.&quot;]
*   **Asset:** BBBB (Probability: 80%) - [Describe the trade recommendation - e.g., &quot;Short position recommended with entry at X, stop loss at Y.&quot;]
*   **Asset:** EEEE (Probability: 85%) - [Describe the trade recommendation - e.g., &quot;Long position recommended with entry at X, stop loss at Y.&quot;]
*   **Asset:** DDDD (Probability: 90%) - [Describe the trade recommendation - e.g., &quot;Short position recommended with entry at X, stop loss at Y.&quot;]</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation and what <em>would</em> happen if the files were accessible:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Access Each File:</strong> For each file path provided (<code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>), I would attempt to open and read the content.</li>
<li><strong>Extract Information:</strong> I would search within the file content for the key pieces of information:
<ul>
<li><code>ASSET_NAME</code>: This is already available from the filename.</li>
<li><code>Trading Position</code>: Whether the recommendation is “LONG” or “SHORT”.</li>
<li><code>Entry Price</code>: The recommended price to enter the trade.</li>
<li><code>Stop Loss</code>: The price level to set the stop loss.</li>
<li><code>Take Profit Probability</code> (or similar): The probability associated with the trade reaching its target profit level. I’d look for a percentage or decimal representing this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Create a Summary:</strong> I would create a structured summary for each asset.</li>
<li><strong>Sort by Probability:</strong> I would sort the list of summaries in ascending order based on the “Take Profit Probability.” The asset with the <em>lowest</em> probability would be at the top, and the asset with the <em>highest</em> probability would be at the bottom.</li>
<li><strong>Output the Sorted List:</strong> I would present the final, sorted list of summaries as shown in the example above.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (Since I can’t run the code):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Format Consistency:</strong> This process relies on the reports having a consistent format so the code can reliably extract the necessary information. If the format varies widely, it will be much more difficult.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> A robust solution would need to handle potential errors such as:
<ul>
<li>Files not found.</li>
<li>Missing data within a report.</li>
<li>Invalid data formats (e.g., a probability not being a number).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Extraction Logic:</strong> The key is how I would extract the information. It would likely involve regular expressions or string parsing techniques specific to the format of your reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because I lack access to the files I can only provide this response in the form of an explanation. Once you provide the contents of the files, I can provide a more accurate and complete response.</p>
