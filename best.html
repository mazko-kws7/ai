<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to the actual report files, I’ll simulate how I would process them based on your description. I’ll make up some example data to demonstrate the output you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the process and example output:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Assume Input:</strong> I’ll assume you provided a list of filenames like this (but I’ll generate the <em>content</em> of each file):</p>
<pre><code>response/AAPL.md
response/GOOG.md
response/MSFT.md
response/AMZN.md</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Simulate Report Content:</strong> For <em>each</em> of those files, I’ll <em>pretend</em> to read its content and extract the relevant information. I’ll simulate the following content structure (it’s just an example):</p>
<pre><code>## Trading Recommendation

**Asset:** AAPL
**Position:** LONG
**Entry Price:** 170.00
**Stop Loss:** 165.00
**Take Profit:** 180.00
**Profit Probability:** 65%</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Extraction:</strong> I’ll extract the asset name (e.g., “AAPL”) and the profit probability (e.g., “65%”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summarization &amp; Sorting:</strong> I’ll create a short summary for each report and then sort the summaries by the profit probability (highest to lowest).</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example Output (Based on Simulated Data):</strong></p>
<p>Here’s what the final output would look like, sorted by profit probability:</p>
<pre><code>*   **Asset:** GOOG, **Profit Probability:** 82%
*   **Asset:** AMZN, **Profit Probability:** 75%
*   **Asset:** AAPL, **Profit Probability:** 65%
*   **Asset:** MSFT, **Profit Probability:** 58%</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation of the Simulated Output:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each line represents a report.</li>
<li>The reports are sorted in descending order of profit probability.</li>
<li>The key information (asset name and profit probability) is clearly presented.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How it would work with <em>real</em> data (if I had access):</strong></p>
<p>If I had access to the <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files, the process would be the same, but I would actually <em>read</em> the content of each file instead of simulating it. The extraction would rely on finding the lines containing “Asset:” and “Profit Probability:” within each file and parsing the values.</p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Format Assumptions:</strong> This assumes a consistent format within your reports (e.g., the labels “Asset:” and “Profit Probability:” are always used). If the format varies, the extraction logic would need to be adjusted accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> In a real-world implementation, I would need to add error handling to gracefully handle cases where a file is missing, a required field is not found, or the format is unexpected.</li>
<li><strong>Command Line Tools (if applicable):</strong> If you want to <em>actually</em> perform this on your own system, you could use command-line tools like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, and <code>sort</code> to achieve the same result. Let me know if you’d like help constructing such a command.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Summary:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve provided a conceptual overview and a simulated example of how I would process your reports and provide the requested summary. If you can provide some real examples of the report content (even if sanitized), I can give you a more precise and actionable solution.</p>
