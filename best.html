<p>Okay, I understand. It seems like I’m supposed to process a list of filenames (like <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>) and then, <em>hypothetically</em>, read those files to extract trading recommendations. Since you’re telling me that the <code>response/*</code> directory doesn’t exist, I <strong>cannot</strong> actually read the files.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will create a <em>simulated</em> resume based on the <em>filenames</em> you provide and <em>assume</em> some reasonable probabilities. This is the best I can do given the information and the error.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how I will proceed (assuming you <em>would</em> provide the list of filenames):</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Parse the Asset Name:</strong> Extract <code>ASSET_NAME</code> from the filename <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Simulate Probability:</strong> Since I can’t read the file, I’ll assign a <em>random</em> probability between 0% and 100% to each asset. In a real scenario, I would be <em>reading the file</em> and extracting the actual probability value from it.</li>
<li><strong>Create Resume Entry:</strong> Create an entry like this: <code>ASSET_NAME: Profit Probability = XX%</code></li>
<li><strong>Sort:</strong> Sort the entries based on the <em>simulated</em> probability, from highest to lowest.</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> Display the sorted list.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example (if you were to provide the following list of files):</strong></p>
<pre><code>response/AAPL.md
response/GOOG.md
response/MSFT.md
response/TSLA.md
response/AMZN.md</code></pre>
<p><strong>The <em>simulated</em> output would look something like this (probabilities are random):</strong></p>
<pre><code>MSFT: Profit Probability = 92%
AAPL: Profit Probability = 78%
GOOG: Profit Probability = 65%
AMZN: Profit Probability = 45%
TSLA: Profit Probability = 23%</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error:</strong> The <code>tail</code> error indicates a problem with the file paths or the existence of the directory <code>response/</code>. Make sure that directory exists and that the files are actually there. You need to fix this problem before any real data processing can occur.</li>
<li><strong>File Format:</strong> I’m assuming that the reports are plain text files and that the probability is clearly labeled within the file. If the reports are in a different format (e.g., JSON, CSV), or if the probability is not easily identifiable, the code I would need to write to parse the files would be different.</li>
<li><strong>Command Line:</strong> You likely intend to pipe the output of a command like <code>ls response/*.md</code> to this process. Make sure <code>ls response/*.md</code> returns the correct list of files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To get a <em>real</em> resume, you need to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Fix the file path issue:</strong> Make sure the <code>response/</code> directory exists and contains the <code>*.md</code> files.</li>
<li><strong>Provide the list of filenames:</strong> Give me the actual list of filenames, one per line, as you originally intended.</li>
<li><strong>Describe the file format more precisely:</strong> Tell me exactly how the probability, entry price, and stop loss are formatted within each <code>*.md</code> file. For example: “The file contains a line that says <code>Profit Probability: 75%</code>.” The more detail you give me, the better I can extract the data.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Until you provide the actual file list and format details, I can only give you a hypothetical example.</strong></p>
