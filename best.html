<h2 id="ada-usd"><a href="./ADA-USD.html">ADA-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 80%</li>
<li>The potential approval of an ADA ETF and its integration into OpenBank suggest long-term growth potential. Technical analysis shows a double-bottom formation at $0.5025, signalling a bullish reversal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apt-usd"><a href="./APT-USD.html">APT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The low confidence stems from the fact that APT is in a sideways trend. If key support at $4.55 fails, and the broader market shows weakness, a sell-off could occur.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aave-usd"><a href="./AAVE-USD.html">AAVE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The price is below the 50-day moving average. The recent price action on both the daily and hourly charts suggests bearish momentum. Potential regulatory risks and competition in the DeFi space could further pressure the price</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="arb-usd"><a href="./ARB-USD.html">ARB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="atom-usd"><a href="./ATOM-USD.html">ATOM-USD</a></h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="bgb-usd"><a href="./BGB-USD.html">BGB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Although BGB has shown positive momentum, the overall crypto market is showing mixed signals, with some sources reporting a decrease. The sideways movement on the daily chart could be a distribution pattern. A decisive break below $5.00 would confirm the sell signal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="eos-usd"><a href="./EOS-USD.html">EOS-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Downward trend observed in both short-term (hourly) and long-term (daily) charts. Negative technical indicators (“strong sell” signals). Tether ceasing support for USDT on EOS.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="btc-usd"><a href="./BTC-USD.html">BTC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="dexe-usd"><a href="./DEXE-USD.html">DEXE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
<li>Given the “strong sell” signals from some technical analysis and the recent price volatility, there may be downward pressure on DEXE-USD. If you bought at a higher price, it might be a good time to reduce holdings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cro-usd"><a href="./CRO-USD.html">CRO-USD</a></h2>

<h2 id="bgb-usd-1"><a href="./BGB-USD.html">BGB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>The recent price increase due to the token burn suggests positive momentum. The price is currently in the $5.08 - $5.30 range, which may represent a buying opportunity if the overall market sentiment improves. The daily chart shows a recent large increase and then sideways movement. The hourly chart shows a high of $5.39, with the price currently consolidating around $5.20. If the price breaks above $5.40, that would confirm the buy signal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bch-usd-1"><a href="./BCH-USD.html">BCH-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
