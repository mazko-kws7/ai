<p>Okay, I understand. Since you encountered an error ( <code>tail: cannot open &#39;response/*&#39; for reading: No such file or directory</code>), it means I cannot access or process the files.</p>
<p>However, I can still give you the logic and format I WOULD use if I <em>could</em> read the reports. I will assume the content of each file looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code># Trading Recommendation

Asset:  [ASSET_NAME]

Position: LONG  (or SHORT)

Entry Price: 123.45

Stop Loss: 122.00

Take Profit: 125.00

Profit Probability: 0.75 (example)</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the process and output format I would use, assuming I had access to the files:</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Parse Filename and Content:</strong> For each file path like <code>response/AAPL.md</code>, extract the <code>ASSET_NAME</code> (e.g., <code>AAPL</code>). Then, I would read the content of the file and parse out the <code>Profit Probability</code> value. (This assumes a consistent format like shown above).</li>
<li><strong>Create Summary:</strong> Create a summary object/dictionary containing the <code>ASSET_NAME</code> and <code>Profit Probability</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Collect Summaries:</strong> Store each summary in a list.</li>
<li><strong>Sort:</strong> Sort the list of summaries in <em>descending</em> order based on the <code>Profit Probability</code> value (highest probability first).</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> Print the sorted summaries in the format you requested.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example Output (if I had the data):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Summary of Trading Recommendations (Sorted by Take Profit Probability):

Asset: GOOGL, Profit Probability: 0.85
Asset: MSFT, Profit Probability: 0.78
Asset: AAPL, Profit Probability: 0.75
Asset: AMZN, Profit Probability: 0.62
Asset: TSLA, Profit Probability: 0.55</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important Notes and Considerations (since I can’t run this):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> In a real implementation, I would need robust error handling to deal with files that don’t exist, files with incorrect formats, or missing probability values. I would log errors and potentially skip those files.</li>
<li><strong>Parsing:</strong> The parsing of the file content would depend heavily on the <em>exact</em> format of the reports. I’ve assumed a simple key-value structure, but more complex formats might require regular expressions or dedicated parsing libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Data Types:</strong> I would ensure that the “Profit Probability” is correctly converted to a numerical type (e.g., a float) for accurate sorting.</li>
<li><strong>File Access:</strong> I’d need the correct permissions to read the files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve provided the logic I would use to solve your problem. You’ll need to implement the file reading and parsing parts of the code yourself, using your programming language of choice and making sure to handle potential errors. Remember to adjust the parsing logic to match the <em>actual</em> format of your trading reports. Once you have the data available in a suitable format (e.g., a list of dictionaries), you can easily sort and print it as desired.</p>
