<p>Okay, I understand. It seems like you intended to provide me with the contents of several markdown files named <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>, but there was an error because those files couldn’t be found. Since I don’t have access to those files, I’ll give you the general format of how I <em>would</em> respond if I <em>did</em> have the data.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file contains text including strings like:
<ul>
<li>“Recommendation: SHORT” or “Recommendation: LONG”</li>
<li>“Entry Price: 1.2345”</li>
<li>“Stop Loss: 1.2300”</li>
<li>“Profit Probability: 75%”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I can reliably extract those values from the text of the file.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Response (if I had the data):</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here’s a summary of the trading reports, sorted by profit probability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset: XYZ (LONG), Profit Probability: 60%</strong> <em>(Extracted from response/XYZ.md)</em></li>
<li><strong>Asset: ABC (SHORT), Profit Probability: 70%</strong> <em>(Extracted from response/ABC.md)</em></li>
<li><strong>Asset: DEF (LONG), Profit Probability: 85%</strong> <em>(Extracted from response/DEF.md)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How it <em>would</em> work, step-by-step:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Input:</strong> I would receive the list of filenames you provide (e.g., <code>response/XYZ.md</code>, <code>response/ABC.md</code>, <code>response/DEF.md</code>).</li>
<li><strong>File Access (if possible):</strong> I would attempt to read the contents of each file. (This is where it failed in your example, as I don’t have access to your local file system).</li>
<li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> For each file:
<ul>
<li>I would parse the text of the file.</li>
<li>I would extract the <code>ASSET_NAME</code> from the filename (e.g., <code>XYZ</code> from <code>response/XYZ.md</code>).</li>
<li>I would extract the <code>Recommendation</code> (LONG or SHORT), <code>Entry Price</code>, <code>Stop Loss</code>, and <code>Profit Probability</code> using string matching or regular expressions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> I would store the extracted data in a suitable data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries).</li>
<li><strong>Sorting:</strong> I would sort the data structure by <code>Profit Probability</code> in ascending order.</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> I would generate a formatted string summarizing each asset and its profit probability, in the sorted order.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> To get a useful response, you need to provide the <em>content</em> of each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file directly to me. I can’t access files on your computer. Once you provide the content, I can parse it and provide the summarized, sorted list. Provide the content of each file one at a time, and I’ll accumulate them until you tell me you’re finished. Then I will produce the summary.</p>
