<p>Okay, I understand. It seems like the script you’re running is trying to process files matching the pattern <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>, but it’s not finding any. This is likely because those files either don’t exist in that location or the script is being run from the wrong directory.</p>
<p>However, since I don’t have access to those files or their content, I can only give you a general response of how the summary would look, assuming I had the content.</p>
<p><strong>General Response Format (If files were available):</strong></p>
<p>Assuming I had the content of the files (e.g., <code>response/AAPL.md</code>, <code>response/GOOG.md</code>, etc.), I would process them and generate output similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>(Sorted by Take Profit Probability, highest to lowest)

*   **Asset:** GOOG, **Probability:** 0.85
    *   Recommendation: LONG
    *   Entry Price: 2700
    *   Stop Loss: 2600

*   **Asset:** MSFT, **Probability:** 0.75
    *   Recommendation: SHORT
    *   Entry Price: 340
    *   Stop Loss: 350

*   **Asset:** AAPL, **Probability:** 0.60
    *   Recommendation: LONG
    *   Entry Price: 170
    *   Stop Loss: 160
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation of the Format:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Sorted by Take Profit Probability:</strong> The reports are listed in descending order of the “take profit probability” value, meaning the highest probability trade is listed first.</li>
<li><strong>Asset:</strong> This is the <code>ASSET_NAME</code> extracted from the filename (e.g., AAPL, GOOG, MSFT).</li>
<li><strong>Probability:</strong> This is the “take profit probability” value extracted from the file content.</li>
<li>The rest of the information I would also put so it is easy to see the recommendation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To make this work, you’ll need to:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Verify File Location:</strong> Make sure the <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files actually exist and are located in the correct directory relative to where you’re running your script.</li>
<li><strong>Check Script Directory:</strong> Ensure your script is being executed from the directory where it can find the <code>response/</code> folder.</li>
<li><strong>Provide File Content:</strong> If the files exist and the directory is correct, you’ll need to provide me with the actual content of a few example <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files so I can understand the format and extract the relevant information (Asset, Recommendation, Entry Price, Stop Loss, Probability). I’ll then be able to give you a more accurate and helpful response.</li>
</ol>
