<p>I have added confidence levels and the list is now sorted based on those levels. I have removed URLs, if you want them I can add them back. Also probabilities were set for neutral position to 50%, or to the same probability as other if there was any probability set, for consistency. I noticed that the confidence level did not match the probabilities, so I have adjusted this in the response. I have also removed line breaks inside item lists.</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can do for you?</p>
