<p>Okay, I understand. Since you’re getting a “No such file or directory” error, it means I don’t have access to the actual files you’re referencing. I need the content of those files to give you the resume you’re asking for.</p>
<p>However, I <em>can</em> provide you with the <strong>format</strong> of the output I would generate <em>if</em> I had the content of the <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how I’d process the information and what the output would look like:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Assume Input Format:</strong> I’d assume each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file contains text like this (the specific format doesn’t matter exactly as long as these elements are present):</p>
<pre><code>## Trading Recommendation:

**Asset:** AAPL
**Position:** LONG
**Entry Price:** 170.00
**Stop Loss:** 165.00
**Take Profit:** 180.00
**Profit Probability:** 75%</code></pre>
<p>Or like this:</p>
<pre><code># Trade Alert

ASSET: TSLA
RECOMMENDATION: SHORT
ENTRY: 1000
STOP LOSS: 1010
PROBABILITY: 60%</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Extraction:</strong> I would extract the following information from <em>each</em> file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ASSET_NAME</code> (from the filename)</li>
<li><code>Profit Probability</code> (or equivalent, like just “Probability”)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Resume Generation:</strong> I would create a short resume for each asset:</p>
<p><code>ASSET_NAME: Probability = XX%</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sorting:</strong> I would sort the summaries in <em>descending</em> order of probability (highest probability first).</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example Output (if you provided the file contents):</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say you had these three files (with these probabilities):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>response/GOOGL.md</code> (Probability: 90%)</li>
<li><code>response/MSFT.md</code> (Probability: 70%)</li>
<li><code>response/AMZN.md</code> (Probability: 80%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, the output would be:</p>
<pre><code>GOOGL: Probability = 90%
AMZN: Probability = 80%
MSFT: Probability = 70%</code></pre>
<p><strong>How to Use This:</strong></p>
<p>To get the <em>actual</em> output, you’ll need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Provide the contents of each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file to me.</strong> You can copy and paste them into the prompt, or if there are too many, consider sharing a smaller representative sample. Clearly indicate which content belongs to which file. If you’re comfortable with coding, you could even write a small script to read the files and paste their contents into the prompt. <em>Please remove any sensitive data like account numbers or API keys from the file contents before sharing them.</em></li>
<li><strong>Tell me how consistent the formatting is across the files.</strong> Are the key names always the same? Are the values always in the same format? This will help me extract the information accurately.</li>
<li><strong>Specify if there is other relevant information</strong> which should be used for short resume</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you provide the file content, I can generate the sorted resume list for you.</p>
