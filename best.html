<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows some signs of price stabilization after a recent decline. If the price breaks above a resistance level (e.g., $0.022), it could indicate renewed upward momentum. “ACT/USDT is showing a steady bullish structure as price sustains above key support levels with rising volume, suggesting accumulation before a breakout.

<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="atom-usd"><a href="./ATOM-USD.html">ATOM-USD</a></h2>
<ul>

<li>The daily chart indicates a strong downtrend. Several sources suggest Cosmos will range between $3.15 and $3.21, with a slight increase by October 2026 [5].
