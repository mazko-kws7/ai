<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to any files and received an error message indicating that the files cannot be found, I will <strong>assume</strong> the following structure for each report’s content:</p>
<p>Each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file contains text that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The trading position recommendation (either “SHORT” or “LONG”).</li>
<li>The entry price (a numerical value).</li>
<li>The stop loss (a numerical value).</li>
<li>The profit probability (a numerical value, likely a percentage).</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this assumption, I will provide you with a template response that you can adapt to your actual data. The template shows how the output would look if I <em>could</em> read the reports. You would need to manually extract the information from your reports and replace the placeholders in my template.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the template for the output, assuming you provide me with the extracted data:</strong></p>
<pre><code>**Trading Position Recommendation Summary (Sorted by Take Profit Probability)**

(Remember to manually fill in the data below based on your report files)

*   **Asset: [ASSET_NAME_1]** - Probability: [PROBABILITY_1] - Recommendation: [LONG/SHORT]
*   **Asset: [ASSET_NAME_2]** - Probability: [PROBABILITY_2] - Recommendation: [LONG/SHORT]
*   **Asset: [ASSET_NAME_3]** - Probability: [PROBABILITY_3] - Recommendation: [LONG/SHORT]
*   ... and so on ...

**Example based on made up data**
*   **Asset: BTCUSD** - Probability: 85% - Recommendation: LONG
*   **Asset: ETHUSD** - Probability: 70% - Recommendation: SHORT
*   **Asset: AAPL** - Probability: 60% - Recommendation: LONG

**Instructions for using the template:**

1.  **Extract Data:** For each `response/ASSET_NAME.md` file, open it and find the `ASSET_NAME`, the &quot;Profit Probability&quot; (or similar term), and the trading position recommendation (&quot;SHORT&quot; or &quot;LONG&quot;).
2.  **Fill the Template:** Replace the bracketed placeholders (`[ASSET_NAME_X]`, `[PROBABILITY_X]`, `[LONG/SHORT]`) with the actual values you extracted.
3.  **Sort:**  Once you&#39;ve filled in the template for all your assets, sort the list from the highest &quot;Probability&quot; to the lowest.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Error Handling:** Because I can&#39;t read the files, I can&#39;t provide any error handling. If a report is missing information, you&#39;ll need to handle that manually.
*   **Probability Format:**  Make sure the probability is consistently formatted (e.g., as a percentage or a decimal) before sorting.

**How to use this with your data:**

You&#39;ll have to process your files separately (using a script, manual editing, etc.) and then provide me with the extracted data. For example, you could give me a list like this:
</code></pre>
<p>BTCUSD, 85%, LONG ETHUSD, 70%, SHORT AAPL, 60%, LONG ```</p>
<p>And then I could format it into the desired output.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have a different way to provide the data! Once you have the extracted information, I can format it and sort it for you.</p>
