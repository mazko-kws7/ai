<li>The price is trading near the lower end of its recent range on the daily chart. Hypothetically, if the RSI dips below 35 while the price holds above a key support level (e.g., $390), it <em>could</em> present a buying opportunity.

<h2 id="eth-usd-1"><a href="./ETH-USD.html">ETH-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>ETH is currently consolidating. If it holds above immediate support (around $2,450 - $2,500), and the RSI indicates oversold conditions in the short term, it could present a buying opportunity. News of institutional buying or positive ETF flows could further support this scenario.</li>
