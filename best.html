<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>The recent dip to near $121,000 appears to be a pause rather than a pivot, according to analysts [14]. “Uptober” sentiment is still in play [14]. The hourly chart data needs further analysis to confirm a precise entry point, but the overall bullish trend and positive sentiment suggest a potential buying opportunity. RSI may indicate oversold conditions in the short term, warranting a buy [4].</li>

<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Downtrend on the daily chart, negative news sentiment, and the inherent risk associated with meme coins suggest further downside potential. Recent price declines and “sell” technical ratings further reinforce this.</li>

<h2 id="jup-usd-1"><a href="./JUP-USD.html">JUP-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 85%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="fil-usd-1"><a href="./FIL-USD.html">FIL-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>FIL is trading below key moving averages, and the overall technical analysis leans bearish . Mixed momentum signals and broader risk-off sentiment in the crypto sector limit upside potential [10, 15]. Recent price analysis suggests a sideways range, but a decrease is more likely [10].</li>
