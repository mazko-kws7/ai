<p>Here’s a resume of each report, sorted by take profit probability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HYPE-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Take-Profit: 60%</li>
<li><strong>ATOM-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Take Profit (Estimated): 60%.</li>
<li><strong>BGB-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Take Profit: Given the overall downtrend, I’d estimate the probability of hitting the take profit target at 4.10 at around 60-70%. However, crypto markets are volatile, so this is highly speculative. Probability of hit first take profit 4.30 should be higher.</li>
<li><strong>ENA-USD</strong>: SHORT, Profit (Take-Profit Hit): Roughly 60% (Estimated based on the strength of the daily downtrend and assuming resistance on hourly holds). Because downtrend has great impact and consolidations on daily means potential continuation.</li>
<li><strong>AVAX-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Profit (Take Profit Hit): I would estimate the probability of hitting the take-profit target is around 65%. This is because the overall trend is down, and the recent hourly price action suggests a continuation of the bearish momentum. Also Risk/Reward Ratio is great.</li>
<li><strong>DOGE-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Take Profit: 60%. This is based on the overall downtrend and the assumption that the recent consolidation is a temporary pause before further declines.</li>
<li><strong>FIL-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Hitting Take-Profit: 65%. The downtrend has been relatively strong, but the recent consolidation suggests some weakening.</li>
<li><strong>KAS-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of hitting Take-Profit: 60%</li>
<li><strong>APT-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Hitting Take Profit (4.30): 60% The overall downtrend on the daily chart gives a higher probability that the price will continue downward to at least the 4.30 level, which was previous support.</li>
<li><strong>DEXE-USD</strong>: LONG, Probability of Hitting Take Profit at target 1 : 50%.</li>
<li><strong>BCH-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Hitting Take-Profit: 50%. The overall trend is sideways to slightly down, and the price has bounced from a significant low. If the bearish trend continues, the take-profit is likely. If the bounce has more momentum the take-profit target could be invalidated.</li>
<li><strong>JUP-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Take Profit: 60%. The probability is based on the strong downward trend observed on the daily chart and the recent price action on the hourly chart. It’s likely the price will continue to fall.</li>
<li><strong>CRO-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Hitting Take Profit: 55-65%. This is based on the prevailing downtrend and the assumption that the consolidation will resolve downward.</li>
<li><strong>ETH-USD</strong>: LONG, Probability of Hitting Take-Profit: 40% -50%.</li>
<li><strong>FET-USD</strong>: LONG, Probability of Hitting Take-Profit: I would estimate the probability of hitting the take-profit target at 40-50%. The market is still in a downtrend, and resistance levels are likely to hold.</li>
<li><strong>CFX-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Hitting Take-Profit Target 1: 40%. The downtrend is still in place, and the consolidation could break downwards.</li>
<li><strong>LINK-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Take-Profit: 55%. This is based on the following assumptions: The overall trend is upward, the current pullback is likely a temporary correction, and the price is expected to resume its upward trajectory.</li>
<li><strong>HBAR-USD</strong>: LONG, Probability of Hitting Take Profit: 40%. This is a counter-trend trade, making it riskier. However, the recent accumulation suggests a possibility of a short-term bounce.</li>
<li><strong>ICP-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Take Profit: 60%. The prevailing downtrend increases the likelihood that the price will reach the take-profit target.</li>
<li><strong>IMX-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Hitting Take Profit: 60%. The downtrend is strong.</li>
<li><strong>INJ-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Profit (Take Profit): I estimate the probability of hitting the take profit target at around 65%. This is due to the overall downtrend and the potential for the recent uptick to be a short-lived correction.</li>
<li><strong>KSM-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Success (Hitting Take-Profit Target): I’d estimate this at around 60%. This is based on the assumption that the downtrend will likely resume and that the short-term uptrend is corrective.</li>
<li><strong>LDO-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Profit (Hitting Take Profit): I estimate the probability of hitting the initial take profit target (0.6800) to be around 60-65%. This is based on the strength of the overall downtrend and the reasonable risk-reward ratio.</li>
<li><strong>NEIRO-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Profit (Hitting Take-Profit): 55%. This is based on the assumption that the downtrend on the daily chart will continue, and recent resistance will hold.</li>
<li><strong>OM-USD</strong>: LONG, Probability of Profit: I would estimate a 60% probability of hitting the take-profit target. This is based on the strength of the underlying uptrend and the expectation that the correction is nearing its end.</li>
<li><strong>ONDO-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Profit (Take-Profit Hit): I estimate the probability of hitting the take-profit target to be approximately 55%. This is based on the strength of the overall downtrend and the potential for the consolidation to resolve downwards.</li>
<li><strong>DOT-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Profit: Given the strength of the downtrend on the daily chart, the descending triangle chart pattern on the hourly, and the favorable risk/reward ratio, I estimate the probability of hitting the take-profit target to be around 65-70%.</li>
<li><strong>EOS-USD</strong>: LONG, Probability of Hitting Take-Profit: 55%. The risk/reward ratio is 2.7 which is very favorable and indicate trade probability is higher than 50%.</li>
<li><strong>LTC-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Profit: I estimate a 60-70% probability of hitting the take-profit target, given the strength of the downtrend on the daily chart and confirmation on hourly timeframe.</li>
<li><strong>NEAR-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Take Profit (2.05): 65%</li>
<li><strong>ADA-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Reaching Take-Profit (0.6200): 55%. The recent price action shows that the price has tested levels around 0.6200 multiple times, making it a realistic target. The overall downtrend supports this probability.</li>
<li><strong>GT-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Hitting Take Profit (21.0): 40%</li>
<li><strong>TRX-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Profit: I’d estimate a conditional probability of around 55-60% for hitting the take-profit target given that the trade is entered at the specified price.</li>
<li><strong>OP-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Take Profit: 60-65%.</li>
<li><strong>ALGO-USD</strong>: SHORT, Probability of Reaching Take Profit: Given the prevailing downtrend on the daily chart and consolidation on hourly chart.</li>
</ul>
