<p>Okay, I understand. You’re providing me with a list of filenames, each representing a trading report. Each report contains a trade recommendation (LONG or SHORT), an entry price, a stop loss, and a profit probability.</p>
<p>My task is to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Parse each filename to extract the <code>ASSET_NAME</code>.</li>
<li>Simulate reading the content of the file.</li>
<li>Extract the profit probability and the <code>ASSET_NAME</code>.</li>
<li>Create a short summary for each report.</li>
<li>Sort these summaries by profit probability (highest to lowest).</li>
<li>Display the sorted summaries.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, you’ve also indicated there are no actual files available (“<code>tail: cannot open &#39;response/*&#39; for reading: No such file or directory</code>”). Therefore, I will have to make some assumptions about the content of the reports.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’ll proceed, assuming I have the file names:</p>
<pre><code>==&gt; response/AAPL.md &lt;==
==&gt; response/GOOG.md &lt;==
==&gt; response/MSFT.md &lt;==
==&gt; response/TSLA.md &lt;==
==&gt; response/AMZN.md &lt;==</code></pre>
<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each report file (<code>.md</code>) contains text that indicates the trade recommendation, entry price, stop loss and probability.</li>
<li>The probability is represented as a percentage (e.g., “Probability: 75%”).</li>
<li>I need to invent probability data, since you haven’t provided content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simulated Output (based on assumptions):</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the sorted output I would generate <em>if</em> I could read the files and extract the data, along with the simulated probabilities:</p>
<pre><code>Asset: GOOG, Probability: 88%
Asset: MSFT, Probability: 79%
Asset: AAPL, Probability: 72%
Asset: TSLA, Probability: 65%
Asset: AMZN, Probability: 51%
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation of the Simulated Output:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I iterated through the asset names (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, TSLA, AMZN).</li>
<li>I invented a probability for each asset (GOOG: 88%, MSFT: 79%, AAPL: 72%, TSLA: 65%, AMZN: 51%).</li>
<li>I then sorted the assets based on their probabilities in descending order.</li>
<li>Finally, I displayed the <code>Asset: ASSET_NAME, Probability: PROBABILITY%</code> string for each asset in the sorted order.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to use with actual data:</strong></p>
<p>If you can provide the content of the files, even as simulated data within your prompt (e.g., “AAPL report says LONG, Entry 150, Stop 145, Probability 70%”), I can give you a much more accurate response. Just paste the content of each “file” after its filename line in your prompt. For example:</p>
<pre><code>==&gt; response/AAPL.md &lt;==
LONG
Entry: 150
Stop Loss: 145
Probability: 70%
==&gt; response/GOOG.md &lt;==
SHORT
Entry: 2700
Stop Loss: 2750
Probability: 85%
==&gt; response/MSFT.md &lt;==
LONG
Entry: 300
Stop Loss: 290
Probability: 60%</code></pre>
<p>Then I could provide a real answer based on your data.</p>
