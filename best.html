<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to the file system or the content of any <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files, I’ll provide you with a template response assuming you’ll fill in the details.</p>
<p>Here’s the template and explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the Goal</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to create a summary of each trading report (<code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>), focusing on:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Asset Name:</strong> The <code>ASSET_NAME</code> part of the filename.</li>
<li><strong>Profit Probability:</strong> The probability that the trade will reach the take profit level, as stated in the report.</li>
</ol>
<p>And then to <strong>sort</strong> these summaries based on the profit probability, in <em>descending</em> order (highest probability first).</p>
<p><strong>Template Response (Fill in the details)</strong></p>
<pre><code>Here&#39;s a summary of the trading reports, sorted by Take Profit Probability:

*   **ASSET_NAME_1:** Probability: PROBABILITY_1%  (Details: LONG/SHORT, Entry Price, Stop Loss)
*   **ASSET_NAME_2:** Probability: PROBABILITY_2%  (Details: LONG/SHORT, Entry Price, Stop Loss)
*   **ASSET_NAME_3:** Probability: PROBABILITY_3%  (Details: LONG/SHORT, Entry Price, Stop Loss)
*   **ASSET_NAME_4:** Probability: PROBABILITY_4%  (Details: LONG/SHORT, Entry Price, Stop Loss)
*   **ASSET_NAME_5:** Probability: PROBABILITY_5%  (Details: LONG/SHORT, Entry Price, Stop Loss)
... and so on, ordered from highest to lowest probability.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>How to Use This Template</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Read Each Report:</strong> Open each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file and extract the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ASSET_NAME:</strong> The name of the asset (from the filename).</li>
<li><strong>Profit Probability:</strong> The probability stated in the report that the trade will reach its take profit target.</li>
<li><strong>Trading position recomendation:</strong> SHORT or LONG</li>
<li><strong>Entry Price:</strong> The recommended entry price for the trade.</li>
<li><strong>Stop Loss:</strong> The recommended stop-loss price.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Create Summaries:</strong> Create a short summary for each report in the format: `* <strong>ASSET_NAME:</strong> Probability: PROBABILITY% (Details: LONG/SHORT, Entry Price, Stop Loss)`</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sort by Probability:</strong> Sort the summaries based on the <code>PROBABILITY</code> value, from highest to lowest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fill in the Template:</strong> Paste the sorted summaries into the template above.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example (Hypothetical)</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say you have these files and probabilities (after reading them):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>response/AAPL.md</code>: Probability: 75%, LONG Entry Price: $150, Stop Loss: $145</li>
<li><code>response/GOOG.md</code>: Probability: 60%, SHORT Entry Price: $2700, Stop Loss: $2750</li>
<li><code>response/MSFT.md</code>: Probability: 80%, LONG Entry Price: $250, Stop Loss: $245</li>
<li><code>response/TSLA.md</code>: Probability: 70%, SHORT Entry Price: $1000, Stop Loss: $1020</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the final response would be:</p>
<pre><code>Here&#39;s a summary of the trading reports, sorted by Take Profit Probability:

*   **MSFT:** Probability: 80% (Details: LONG, Entry Price: $250, Stop Loss: $245)
*   **AAPL:** Probability: 75% (Details: LONG, Entry Price: $150, Stop Loss: $145)
*   **TSLA:** Probability: 70% (Details: SHORT, Entry Price: $1000, Stop Loss: $1020)
*   **GOOG:** Probability: 60% (Details: SHORT, Entry Price: $2700, Stop Loss: $2750)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> If you encounter any errors while reading the files (e.g., a file is missing or corrupted), handle them gracefully and log the error.</li>
<li><strong>Probability Format:</strong> Ensure that all probabilities are in the same format (e.g., all percentages).</li>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> Remember that profit probability is just one factor to consider when making trading decisions. Always use your own judgment and risk management strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong> Put trading position, entry price and stop loss details inside the description.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. I am ready for the list of results in format like <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> to process them.</p>
