<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>
<li>If DOGE fails to break through the $0.287 resistance, consider a short-term sell. The “buy the rumor, sell the news” reaction to the ETF launch suggests caution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="arb-usd"><a href="./ARB-USD.html">ARB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>
<li>ARB has faced rejection at the $0.52 resistance point, with the MACD histogram confirming bearish momentum. The price sits near the 200-day SMA ($0.39197), a critical long-term support level. The failure to reclaim $0.52 suggests short-term sellers are dominating.</li>

<h2 id="etc-usd"><a href="./ETC-USD.html">ETC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>
<li>The hourly chart indicates a lack of strong trend and low trading volume, suggesting consolidation. Approaching overbought conditions on the daily chart (RSI near 70) may lead to a short-term pullback.</li>

The RSI, although not explicitly available from the hourly data, is likely approaching overbought territory after the recent surge. Given the potential for short-term profit-taking, a sell signal is generated.</li>
</ul>
