<h2 id="bch-usd"><a href="./BCH-USD.html">BCH-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Given the recent volatility and mixed signals, it may be prudent to sell a portion of holdings if you are already in a profitable position. This can help secure some gains in case of a potential market correction. Recent news also indicates the trend has shifted bearish in the short term with rising sell volume and repeated rejections at $615–$617.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atom-usd"><a href="./ATOM-USD.html">ATOM-USD</a></h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="etc-usd"><a href="./ETC-USD.html">ETC-USD</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
<li>CFX is in a short-term downtrend, facing resistance at previous levels. The MACD is likely bearish. Regulatory risks in China and altcoin underperformance could weigh on the price. The 7-day SMA ($0.173) now acting as resistance, traders are eyeing support near $0.164 [14]. A sustained break below $0.164 could accelerate selling toward $0.15 [14].</li>
