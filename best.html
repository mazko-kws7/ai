<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>ATOM is currently near a historical support zone (around $2.45-$1.95). A long lower wick on the weekly chart suggests a potential liquidity sweep and accumulation by “smart money.” Positive daily momentum and trading above key moving averages further support a potential rebound.</li>

<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows a recent bottom around $14.70, with some signs of consolidation and a slight upward movement.

</ul>
<h2 id="ftn-usd-1"><a href="./FTN-USD.html">FTN-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows intraday volatility. If the price dips to support levels (around 1.72-1.73), a quick scalp trade might be possible. However, this is risky due to the overall downtrend.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gt-usd-1"><a href="./GT-USD.html">GT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The very high volume bar on the daily chart could indicate panic selling and might be followed by a short-term correction upwards.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="kas-usd-1"><a href="./KAS-USD.html">KAS-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows price consolidating around $0.05. If the price breaks above $0.0508 (resistance seen in hourly data), it could signal a short-term upward move.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ksm-usd-1"><a href="./KSM-USD.html">KSM-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The daily chart shows a significant price drop, but KSM has shown resilience at these levels in the past. If the price stabilizes around the $10 level, it may present a buying opportunity for a potential long-term recovery.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ldo-usd-1"><a href="./LDO-USD.html">LDO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The longer-term moving averages suggest a buy. If ETH price increases above $3000, the buyback program might boost the price of LDO. The current price near the recent low could represent an opportunity to enter a long position.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leo-usd"><a href="./LEO-USD.html">LEO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows LEO-USD trading in a narrow range, suggesting consolidation. A recent dip to around 9.00 was quickly bought up, indicating potential support. If the price breaks above the 9.25 level on the hourly chart, it could signal a short-term upward move.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="link-usd-1"><a href="./LINK-USD.html">LINK-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>If the price drops further to a key support level (e.g., based on Fibonacci retracements or historical support), and RSI indicates oversold conditions, a buy signal may emerge. Chainlink’s long-term fundamentals (partnerships, Data Link rollout) remain strong.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ltc-usd-1"><a href="./LTC-USD.html">LTC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>Recent upward movement in hourly charts, positive news regarding ETF approval, and potential for “digital silver” narrative to drive demand. Current price ~$105.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="near-usd-1"><a href="./NEAR-USD.html">NEAR-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>Recent stabilization in the hourly chart after a downtrend, combined with positive news (Grupo Nutresa partnership). The price is near its 7-day low. If RSI indicates oversold conditions on shorter timeframes, it could further strengthen this signal.</li>
