<p>Okay, I understand. You’re giving me a list of filenames in the format <code>==&gt; response/ASSET_NAME.md &lt;==</code>, and you want me to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Read</strong> each report file (assuming I <em>could</em> access them if they existed).</li>
<li><strong>Extract</strong> the asset name (from the filename), the trading position (LONG or SHORT), the entry price, the stop loss, and the profit probability.</li>
<li><strong>Summarize</strong> each report with the asset name and probability.</li>
<li><strong>Sort</strong> these summaries by profit probability (ascending - lowest to highest, or descending - highest to lowest? I’ll assume descending, but specify if you want ascending).</li>
</ol>
<p>Because I have no access to the files, I will give a generic response that tells you what I <em>would</em> do if I <em>did</em> have the files. I will also give you the format of my output, assuming that all reports contain all required information.</p>
<p><strong>My Response (If I Had Access to the Files):</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Okay, I understand. If I had access to the ‘response/’ directory and the files contained the necessary information, I would process each report, extract the relevant data, and provide a sorted summary. The output would look something like this (sorted by take profit probability descending):</p>
<pre><code>Asset: [ASSET_NAME_1], Probability: [PROBABILITY_1] (Position: [LONG/SHORT], Entry: [PRICE], Stop Loss: [PRICE])
Asset: [ASSET_NAME_2], Probability: [PROBABILITY_2] (Position: [LONG/SHORT], Entry: [PRICE], Stop Loss: [PRICE])
Asset: [ASSET_NAME_3], Probability: [PROBABILITY_3] (Position: [LONG/SHORT], Entry: [PRICE], Stop Loss: [PRICE])
... and so on, ordered by probability (highest to lowest).</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example Output (Assuming Data):</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say, hypothetically, I processed the files and found this information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>response/AAPL.md</code> contained a LONG recommendation with 85% probability.</li>
<li><code>response/GOOGL.md</code> contained a SHORT recommendation with 92% probability.</li>
<li><code>response/MSFT.md</code> contained a LONG recommendation with 78% probability.</li>
<li><code>response/TSLA.md</code> contained a SHORT recommendation with 92% probability.</li>
</ul>
<p>My output would be:</p>
<pre><code>Asset: GOOGL, Probability: 92% (Position: SHORT)
Asset: TSLA, Probability: 92% (Position: SHORT)
Asset: AAPL, Probability: 85% (Position: LONG)
Asset: MSFT, Probability: 78% (Position: LONG)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Format:</strong> This assumes a consistent file format within each <code>.md</code> file. I’d need to know the exact format (e.g., how the position, entry price, stop loss, and probability are indicated) to accurately extract the information. For example, are they in a table, a specific text pattern, or a JSON structure?</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> I would need to handle cases where a file is missing, a file doesn’t contain the required information, or the data is in an unexpected format.</li>
<li><strong>Sorting:</strong> I’m assuming a numerical or floating-point representation of the probability for accurate sorting.</li>
<li><strong>Tie-breaking:</strong> In case of equal probabilities, the order is arbitrary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To get a real response, you need to provide the content of the files.</strong> You can paste the contents of each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file individually, and I’ll do my best to process them based on their format. Alternatively, if you can describe the <em>structure</em> of the <code>.md</code> files, I can give you a more accurate example output. &quot;</p>
