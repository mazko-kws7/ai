<p>Okay, I understand. Since I can’t access any files (&quot;tail: cannot open ’response/<em>’ for reading: No such file or directory&quot;), I’ll provide a template response that you can adapt based on the </em>actual* content of your reports.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the template response, assuming you would give me the reports:</strong></p>
<p>Okay, I will parse each of your reports, extract the asset name, and profit probability. Then, I’ll sort the summaries by probability and present the results.</p>
<p><strong>Example Response Format (After you provide the report contents):</strong></p>
<p>Sorted by Take Profit Probability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ASSET_D (Probability: 92%):</strong> Recommendation: LONG</li>
<li><strong>ASSET_B (Probability: 85%):</strong> Recommendation: SHORT</li>
<li><strong>ASSET_A (Probability: 70%):</strong> Recommendation: LONG</li>
<li><strong>ASSET_C (Probability: 60%):</strong> Recommendation: SHORT</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation of each line</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>ASSET_D</code>: This is the name of the asset from the report.</li>
<li><code>Probability: 92%</code>: This is the reported profit probability, extracted from the report.</li>
<li><code>Recommendation: LONG</code>: This is main recommendation</li>
<li>The list is sorted in descending order of probability.</li>
<li>If any reports are missing probability data, I’ll either exclude them or mark them accordingly.</li>
<li>If probabilities are identical, I can use the asset name or another criteria for secondary sorting (let me know your preference).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To Use This:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Copy the <em>entire</em> contents of each file (e.g., the contents of <code>response/AAPL.md</code>, then <code>response/GOOG.md</code>, etc.) and paste it into our conversation here on separate lines.</strong> <em>Don’t just tell me what’s in them; I need the full content.</em> It’s easiest if you put each report as a single block with a clear separator between them.</li>
<li>After you’ve pasted all the reports, let me know you’re done. I will then process them and provide the summary in the format above.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example of how to provide the data:</strong></p>
<pre><code>==&gt; response/AAPL.md &lt;==
Trading Recommendation: LONG
Entry Price: 150.00
Stop Loss: 145.00
Profit Probability: 80%

==&gt; response/GOOG.md &lt;==
Trading Recommendation: SHORT
Entry Price: 2700.00
Stop Loss: 2750.00
Profit Probability: 65%

==&gt; response/MSFT.md &lt;==
Trading Recommendation: LONG
Entry Price: 300.00
Stop Loss: 295.00
Profit Probability: 90%

Done providing reports.</code></pre>
<p>Then I would be able to give you this response:</p>
<pre><code>Sorted by Take Profit Probability:

*   **MSFT (Probability: 90%):** Recommendation: LONG
*   **AAPL (Probability: 80%):** Recommendation: LONG
*   **GOOG (Probability: 65%):** Recommendation: SHORT</code></pre>
<p>I’m ready when you are.</p>
