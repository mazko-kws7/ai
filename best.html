<ul>
<li>Neutral 50%</li>
<li>Hold existing positions. Monitor price movements closely. A break above $0.68 with sustained volume could signal a buying opportunity. A drop below $0.62 could indicate further downside. Wait for clearer signals before making significant moves.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="avax-usd"><a href="./AVAX-USD.html">AVAX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Hold/Wait 50%</li>
<li>The long-term outlook for AVAX is mixed. While some analysts predict substantial growth in the coming years, there are also risks associated with market volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Longer-term price predictions vary widely.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="arb-usd"><a href="./ARB-USD.html">ARB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy (Long-Term Accumulation) 50%</li>
<li>If you believe in the long-term potential of Arbitrum and its ecosystem, consider accumulating ARB-USD during price dips, especially near the support level of 0.26-0.30 observed in the daily chart. This strategy is based on fundamental analysis and long-term growth prospects rather than short-term technical indicators.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atom-usd"><a href="./ATOM-USD.html">ATOM-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy (Scalp/Short Term) 60%</li>
<li>ATOM has demonstrated resilience around the $4.25 support level, and recent buying demand suggests a potential short-term bounce. The hourly chart doesn’t show strong momentum, so this should be a quick trade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="algo-usd"><a href="./ALGO-USD.html">ALGO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy (Speculative) 60%</li>
<li>The price is currently near the lower end of its recent consolidation range. RSI indicators from search results indicate oversold conditions. A bounce from this level could present a short-term buying opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="act-usd"><a href="./ACT-USD.html">ACT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The recent small upward movement on the hourly chart, combined with consolidation, suggests a potential short-term buying opportunity if it breaks the immediate resistance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aave-usd"><a href="./AAVE-USD.html">AAVE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>AAVE has demonstrated a recent upward trend, testing resistance levels around $256-$290.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bnb-usd"><a href="./BNB-USD.html">BNB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>The recent dip in the hourly chart suggests a possible short-term oversold condition. If the price shows signs of stabilization around the $640 level, it might indicate a potential rebound. Consider that the overall crypto market is shrinking this week, which is a risk factor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bgb-usd"><a href="./BGB-USD.html">BGB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Hold 65%</li>
<li>Given Bitget’s ongoing efforts to enhance the BGB token’s utility and reduce its supply through token burns, long-term holders might choose to maintain their positions. Positive developments in the Bitget ecosystem or broader adoption of the exchange could contribute to the token’s long-term value.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apt-usd"><a href="./APT-USD.html">APT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>Price above 50-day SMA and RSI indicates oversold conditions, suggesting a potential upward reversal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fet-usd"><a href="./FET-USD.html">FET-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>FET has shown resilience, holding support around $0.70. The hidden RSI divergence indicates potential upward momentum. Furthermore, the market sentiment around FET is turning bullish during this slight turbulence.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dexe-usd"><a href="./DEXE-USD.html">DEXE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>Short-term recovery observed in the hourly chart with potential bullish MACD crossover. The price is currently around $10.61, showing signs of upward momentum after a significant drop in the daily chart.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cfx-usd"><a href="./CFX-USD.html">CFX-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The price has declined significantly in the past three months, potentially creating a buying opportunity if a reversal occurs. Recent positive news (token burn, partnerships) could act as catalysts for a price increase. The RSI (not provided, but assumed based on general analysis) <em>could</em> be entering oversold territory on shorter timeframes, suggesting potential for a bounce.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cro-usd"><a href="./CRO-USD.html">CRO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The recent breakout from a symmetrical triangle (as mentioned in the news) and the generally positive sentiment around a potential Staked CRO ETF could provide short-term upward momentum. The short term consolidation in the hourly chart could mean a breakout is coming.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ena-usd"><a href="./ENA-USD.html">ENA-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>Short-term recovery observed in the hourly chart with potential bullish MACD crossover. The price is currently around $10.61, showing signs of upward momentum after a significant drop in the daily chart.</li>

<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>Bitcoin has shown some resilience after testing the $100,000 support level. Historically, deeply negative funding rates have been followed by strong recoveries. If the price breaks above the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) on the daily chart, it could signal a potential upward move toward $110,000.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="doge-usd"><a href="./DOGE-USD.html">DOGE-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Cautious Buy 60%</li>
<li>RSI indicates oversold conditions, suggesting a possible short-term rebound. The 600-day support trend provides some stability. However, negative news and mixed technical signals warrant caution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="arb-usd-1"><a href="./ARB-USD.html">ARB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows ARB-USD consolidating in a tight range. Potential for a short-term bounce if it breaks above the minor resistance at 0.345.</li>

<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The price is currently consolidating around $21.00, and some analysts predict a breakout above $22.00 could lead to further gains. If AVAX breaks above the near-term resistance, it could signal a buying opportunity.</li>

<h2 id="bch-usd"><a href="./BCH-USD.html">BCH-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="bgb-usd-1"><a href="./BGB-USD.html">BGB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows BGB consolidating in a tight range. A breakout above the recent high of around $4.92, accompanied by an increase in volume, could indicate a short-term buying opportunity. News of upcoming token burns or exchange-specific positive developments may also support this.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enero-usd"><a href="./ENERO-USD.html">ENERO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>
<li>Short-term recovery observed in the hourly chart with potential bullish MACD crossover. The price is currently around $10.61, showing signs of upward momentum after a significant drop in the daily chart.</li>

<h2 id="eos-usd"><a href="./EOS-USD.html">EOS-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The RSI is at 35, signaling an oversold market condition. As part of the decline, the price may slide to $0.45–$0.40. Nevertheless, once the quotes decline to $0.40, a correction towards $1.00 may start, as the price may reach the oversold zone and then recover.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fet-usd-1"><a href="./FET-USD.html">FET-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 65%</li>

<h2 id="kas-usd"><a href="./KAS-USD.html">KAS-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>

<h2 id="algo-usd-1"><a href="./ALGO-USD.html">ALGO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>

<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="bnb-usd-1"><a href="./BNB-USD.html">BNB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>
<li>The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a slight decline this week, which could possibly drive the price down. If BNB-USD fails to hold above $650 and shows bearish signals on the hourly chart (e.g., a break below a key support level), a sell signal might be warranted. Based on TradingView, technical analysis shows a neutral signal, but the one week rating shows a buy signal. It’s best to dig deeper and study the one month rating, which is also buy.</li>
