<p>Okay, I understand. Since you can’t provide the actual files and I’m getting an error, I’ll create a simulated scenario. I’ll <em>imagine</em> I processed some reports matching your description and then provide the summarized output as requested.</p>
<p>Here’s the simulated output based on my understanding of your request:</p>
<p><strong>Simulated Report Analysis (Based on Fictional <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files)</strong></p>
<p>I’ve analyzed several reports named <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>, extracting the asset name, trading recommendation (LONG/SHORT), entry price, stop loss, and profit probability. I’m presenting the summary sorted by profit probability, highest to lowest:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset: GOLD_USD (Probability: 88%)</strong> - Recommendation: LONG</li>
<li><strong>Asset: BITCOIN_USD (Probability: 75%)</strong> - Recommendation: LONG</li>
<li><strong>Asset: EUR_USD (Probability: 65%)</strong> - Recommendation: SHORT</li>
<li><strong>Asset: TESLA_STOCK (Probability: 55%)</strong> - Recommendation: LONG</li>
<li><strong>Asset: OIL_WTI (Probability: 45%)</strong> - Recommendation: SHORT</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each line corresponds to one analyzed <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file.</li>
<li>“Asset: ASSET_NAME” extracts the name (e.g., <code>GOLD_USD</code> from <code>response/GOLD_USD.md</code>).</li>
<li>“Probability: XX%” extracts the stated profit probability from the report.</li>
<li>“Recommendation: LONG/SHORT” represents the trading position recommended.</li>
<li>The entire list is sorted in descending order based on the profit probability percentage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (Because this is a simulation):</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Accuracy Depends on Report Format:</strong> This output <em>assumes</em> a consistent format within each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file where the relevant information (asset name, probability, and recommendation) is clearly identifiable. If the formatting is inconsistent, an actual script would need to be tailored to handle the variations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error Handling:</strong> A real script would need robust error handling to gracefully manage situations like missing probability values or unparsable file formats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extraction Logic:</strong> The simulated extraction is conceptual. An actual script would use regular expressions or other parsing techniques to extract the data.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you were able to provide a sample of the contents of one of the <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files, I could provide a more accurate and targeted response, including example code that would perform this kind of parsing.</p>
