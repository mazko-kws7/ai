<p>Okay, I understand. Since you’re getting a “No such file or directory” error, it means I don’t have access to the actual files. However, I can provide the logic and formatting that <em>would</em> be used if I <em>did</em> have the data.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how I would process the reports and generate the summary:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Parse Each Report:</strong>
<ul>
<li>For each report (e.g., <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>):</li>
<li>I would need to read the file content and extract the following information using pattern matching or regular expressions:
<ul>
<li><code>ASSET_NAME</code> (from the filename).</li>
<li>Trading position (<code>LONG</code> or <code>SHORT</code>).</li>
<li>Entry price (a number).</li>
<li>Stop Loss (a number).</li>
<li>Profit probability (a percentage or a decimal value).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Create Summary Records:</strong>
<ul>
<li>For each report, I would create a dictionary (or a similar data structure) with the extracted information:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;asset_name&quot;: &quot;ASSET_NAME&quot;,
    &quot;position&quot;: &quot;LONG/SHORT&quot;,
    &quot;entry_price&quot;: 123.45,
    &quot;stop_loss&quot;: 122.00,
    &quot;profit_probability&quot;: 0.85  # (as a decimal)
}</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>Sort by Profit Probability:</strong>
<ul>
<li>I would gather all the summary records into a list.</li>
<li>Then, I would sort the list in <em>descending</em> order based on the <code>profit_probability</code> value. This means the highest probability would be at the top.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Generate Output:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Finally, I would iterate through the sorted list and print a short summary for each asset. The output would look something like this:</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>ASSET_NAME: [ASSET_NAME], Probability: [PROFIT_PROBABILITY]
ASSET_NAME: [ASSET_NAME], Probability: [PROFIT_PROBABILITY]
... and so on, sorted by probability</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example Output (If I had access to your files):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Asset: AAPL, Probability: 0.92
Asset: TSLA, Probability: 0.88
Asset: GOOG, Probability: 0.75
Asset: MSFT, Probability: 0.68</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each line represents one asset.</li>
<li>The lines are sorted from highest profit probability to lowest.</li>
<li>I’m assuming your probability values are already normalized to be between 0 and 1 (or that I can easily convert them to that range).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (Given that I cannot access the files):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Format:</strong> I’m assuming your <code>.md</code> files have a consistent format that allows me to easily extract the data. If the format is complex or inconsistent, I would need more specific instructions or examples.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> A real-world implementation would include error handling (e.g., what to do if a file is missing, corrupted, or doesn’t contain the expected information).</li>
<li><strong>Data Types:</strong> I am inferring the datatypes. An actual implementation would need to convert values to their proper data types (e.g., convert strings to numbers for prices and probabilities).</li>
<li><strong>Probability Representation</strong>: Make sure you are consistent with representing probability as a percent or decimal.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can provide a few <em>example</em> lines or the structure of <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files, I can give you a more tailored and precise response. For instance, if you tell me that the profit probability is always on a line that starts with “Profit Probability:”, that would help a lot.</p>
