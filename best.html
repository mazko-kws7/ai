| NEIRO-USD  | Sell          | 80%         | The daily chart suggests a possible downtrend after a significant price increase.

| DOGE-USD   | Sell          | 80%         | For this downtrend and if you have holdings, consider selling a portion of holdings if the price reaches a resistance level around $0.19-$0.20.                                                                                                                                                         |
| AVAX-USD   | Sell          | 80%         | Down trend in prices and a generally bad market situation signals this should be a sell signal.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| PEPE-USD   | Sell          | 80%         | Given the Daily chart indicates a bearish trend, and the price is below the 200-day moving average. Sell if PEPE-USD breaks below a key support level (e.g., 8.6e-06), it could signal a further downward trend.                                                                                   |
