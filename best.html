The daily chart <em>may</em> be approaching oversold conditions based on RSI (though I cannot calculate it directly). Furthermore, the potential for a longer-term move toward $1.50-$1.65 if a breakout occurs. This is a contrarian play.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fil-usd-1"><a href="./FIL-USD.html">FIL-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>Despite the bearish signals, the inclusion of FIL in Grayscale’s AI fund and the potential for seller exhaustion (capitulation-like volume) suggest a possible long-term buying opportunity.</li>
