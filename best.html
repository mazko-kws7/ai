<h2 id="act-usd"><a href="./ACT-USD.html">ACT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The medium-term trend is down. The price has been consolidating recently, but the overall bearish momentum and recent large price drop suggest potential for further decline. Recent daily data shows very low volume, which can indicate lack of interest.</li>

<h2 id="ena-usd"><a href="./ENA-USD.html">ENA-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>However, the overall trend is bearish, with a significant token unlock event coming up, likely to increase selling pressure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="etc-usd"><a href="./ETC-USD.html">ETC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
<li>Given the overall downtrend observed in the daily chart and the inability to break convincingly above the $17.20 level in the hourly chart, a failure to maintain support at $16.20 could lead to further declines.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="fil-usd"><a href="./FIL-USD.html">FIL-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>
<li>The price has been on a downtrend over the past three months (based on provided daily chart data). Several sources indicate bearish sentiment for FIL. The 50-day SMA is 2.75, and the 200-day SMA is 3.85, which confirms that the downtrend may continue. The overall market is in “Greed,” which may lead to a correction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bnb-usd"><a href="./BNB-USD.html">BNB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 65%</li>
<li>The hourly chart shows consolidation, and some technical analysis indicates a potential “sell” signal. If you are holding BNB, this might be an opportunity to take profits, especially if concerned about short-term volatility.</li>

<h2 id="eos-usd"><a href="./EOS-USD.html">EOS-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>

<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
<li>The daily chart shows that FTN-USD has seen a recent increase to around $4.30. The warning from Coinbase about an impending crypto winter and FTN’s underperformance relative to the broader crypto market suggests a potential pullback is likely.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="inj-usd"><a href="./INJ-USD.html">INJ-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
<li>The longer-term daily chart indicates a downtrend. The overall crypto market is susceptible to economic instability and trade tariffs [6].</li>

<h2 id="btc-usd"><a href="./BTC-USD.html">BTC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 55%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="hbar-usd"><a href="./HBAR-USD.html">HBAR-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>
<li>HBAR trades below the dots that make up its Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) indicator. Readings from the HBAR/USD one-day chart suggest that this bearish trend could persist in the short term. Supporting this bearish outlook, HBAR’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remains in the negative territory, signaling a decline in buying volume and a growing presence of sellers in the market.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gt-usd"><a href="./GT-USD.html">GT-USD</a></h2>

<h2 id="ltc-usd"><a href="./LTC-USD.html">LTC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>
<li>LTC has struggled to capitalize on the overall positive sentiment in the crypto market [8]. The lack of significant trading volume during recent rallies indicates weak buying pressure [8].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="neiro-usd"><a href="./NEIRO-USD.html">NEIRO-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 50%</li>
<li>While the price has generally risen over the past three months, the potential for a market correction and the inherent risk of meme coins warrants caution.</li>

<li>If ADA fails to break the $0.74 resistance and shows signs of rejection (e.g., decreasing volume, bearish candlestick patterns), it may continue to trade in a range between $0.68 and $0.74. Given current market conditions, a partial sell to secure profits may be warranted.</li>
