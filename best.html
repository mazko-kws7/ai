<p>Okay, I’ve analyzed the reports you provided and will create a short resume for each, including the asset name and take profit probability, sorted by the probability value.</p>
<p>Here’s the sorted resume:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>ALGO-USD:</strong> Take Profit Probability: 60%</li>
<li><strong>ACT-USD:</strong> Take Profit Probability: 60%</li>
<li><strong>ARB-USD:</strong> Take Profit Probability: 60%</li>
<li><strong>AVAX-USD:</strong> Take Profit Probability: 60-65%</li>
<li><strong>AAVE-USD:</strong> Take Profit Probability: 55-60%</li>
<li><strong>ADA-USD:</strong> Take Profit Probability: 40%</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Probability is Subjective:</strong> Remember that the probability values are highly subjective estimates made by the AI. They are based on the provided data and a general understanding of technical analysis, but they are not guaranteed predictions.</li>
<li><strong>Range Values:</strong> Some reports provided a <em>range</em> for the probability. In the sorted list, I used the higher value of the range for sorting purposes (e.g., “55-60%” was treated as “60%”).</li>
<li><strong>Limited Data:</strong> These reports are based on relatively short timeframes, which can make the probability assessments less reliable. Longer historical datasets and external factors are crucial for more informed trading decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The above information is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.</li>
