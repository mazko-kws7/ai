<p>Okay, I understand the situation.</p>
<p>Even though I don’t have the actual files and am getting a “file not found” error, I can simulate the process based on your description.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’ll respond <em>assuming</em> I could read the files and extract the information:</p>
<p><strong>Simulated Response:</strong></p>
<p>Okay, I will process the reports (if they existed!) and provide a summary sorted by profit probability. The simulated output would look something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Hypothetical Sorted Report Summary (based on take profit probability)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ASSET_D:</strong> 78% probability
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: LONG</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>ASSET_A:</strong> 70% probability
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: SHORT</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>ASSET_C:</strong> 62% probability
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: LONG</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>ASSET_B:</strong> 55% probability
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: SHORT</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation of the Simulated Response:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Asset Name:</strong> Each line starts with the <code>ASSET_NAME</code> extracted from the filename.</li>
<li><strong>Profit Probability:</strong> This is the probability value read from the report.</li>
<li><strong>Sorting:</strong> The list is sorted in <em>descending</em> order based on the profit probability (highest probability first).</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Indicates LONG or SHORT position from the reports.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How it <em>would</em> work if the files were accessible:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>File Iteration:</strong> I would iterate through each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file.</li>
<li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> For each file, I would parse the content (assuming a consistent format) to extract:
<ul>
<li><code>ASSET_NAME</code> (from the filename)</li>
<li>Trading Position Recommendation (LONG or SHORT)</li>
<li>Entry Price (not used for summary but would be available)</li>
<li>Stop Loss (not used for summary but would be available)</li>
<li>Profit Probability</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> I would store the extracted information in a list of dictionaries (or a similar data structure).</li>
<li><strong>Sorting:</strong> I would sort the list based on the “Profit Probability” in descending order.</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> Finally, I would generate the formatted output as shown above.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (If the script worked):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report Format:</strong> This assumes a consistent format for all the <code>*.md</code> reports. If the format varies, the parsing logic would need to be adjusted accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> A real-world script would need robust error handling to deal with missing files, invalid data formats, and other potential issues.</li>
<li><strong>MD Parsing:</strong> I would need a way to parse the Markdown files to reliably extract the required information. Simple string searching or regular expressions could be used, or a more robust Markdown parsing library might be necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> Because the files are missing, I’m giving you the <em>structure</em> of the response I would provide and explaining how I <em>would</em> generate it if the files were available. You would need to implement the file reading and parsing steps based on the actual format of your <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files.</p>
