<p>Okay, I understand. Since you don’t have the actual report files and I can’t access external files, I’ll provide a template response and explain how it <em>would</em> work if you <em>did</em> have the files and their content. I will assume each file contains “Recommendation: [LONG/SHORT]”, “Entry Price: [price]”, “Stop Loss: [price]”, and “Take Profit Probability: [percentage]”.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how the process <em>would</em> work, and a template of how the output would look:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Input (What I’d <em>receive</em> from you):</strong> You would provide a list of filenames like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>response/AssetA.md
response/AssetB.md
response/AssetC.md
response/AssetD.md</code></pre>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Hypothetical File Processing (What I <em>would</em> do if I had the files):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For each filename in the list:
<ul>
<li>Open the file.</li>
<li>Read the file content.</li>
<li>Extract:
<ul>
<li>Asset Name (from the filename - e.g., “AssetA”)</li>
<li>Take Profit Probability (e.g., 75%)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sorting:</strong> Sort the extracted data by “Take Profit Probability” in <em>descending</em> order (highest probability first).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Output (What I would <em>return</em>):</strong> A list of summaries, sorted by Take Profit Probability.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Template Response (Assuming Example Data):</strong></p>
<pre><code>*   AssetC: Take Profit Probability - 90%
*   AssetA: Take Profit Probability - 75%
*   AssetD: Take Profit Probability - 60%
*   AssetB: Take Profit Probability - 50%</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> In a real implementation, there would be error handling to gracefully manage situations where a file doesn’t exist, is unreadable, or doesn’t contain the expected data.</li>
<li><strong>Data Types:</strong> The extracted values (especially the probability) would be converted to appropriate data types (e.g., float or integer) for sorting and calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Expressions or String Parsing:</strong> I would likely use regular expressions or string parsing techniques to reliably extract the desired information from the file content.</li>
<li><strong>Format Consistency:</strong> This assumes a consistent format within your report files. If the format varies, the extraction logic would need to be more flexible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> Provide the list of <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> filenames, and <em>if I could access the files</em>, I would return a sorted list of asset names and their take profit probabilities. Since I can’t access your files, I’ve given you the template output and the process I would use.</p>
