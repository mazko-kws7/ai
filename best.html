<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to the actual content of those files (as I cannot read local files), I will provide you with a template response assuming I <em>could</em> read the files. You would need to <strong>replace the bracketed placeholders with the actual data from each report.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the format I’ll use, designed to be easily filled in and sorted:</p>
<p><strong>Sorted Trading Recommendations (by Take Profit Probability)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset:</strong> [ASSET_NAME], <strong>Probability:</strong> [PROBABILITY]%, <strong>Recommendation:</strong> [SHORT/LONG], Entry: [ENTRY_PRICE], Stop Loss: [STOP_LOSS]</li>
<li><strong>Asset:</strong> [ASSET_NAME], <strong>Probability:</strong> [PROBABILITY]%, <strong>Recommendation:</strong> [SHORT/LONG], Entry: [ENTRY_PRICE], Stop Loss: [STOP_LOSS]</li>
<li><strong>Asset:</strong> [ASSET_NAME], <strong>Probability:</strong> [PROBABILITY]%, <strong>Recommendation:</strong> [SHORT/LONG], Entry: [ENTRY_PRICE], Stop Loss: [STOP_LOSS]</li>
<li>… and so on, with probability increasing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example (how you would fill it in):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sorted Trading Recommendations (by Take Profit Probability)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset:</strong> TSLA, <strong>Probability:</strong> 65%, <strong>Recommendation:</strong> SHORT, Entry: 180.50, Stop Loss: 182.00</li>
<li><strong>Asset:</strong> AAPL, <strong>Probability:</strong> 70%, <strong>Recommendation:</strong> LONG, Entry: 170.00, Stop Loss: 168.50</li>
<li><strong>Asset:</strong> GOOG, <strong>Probability:</strong> 75%, <strong>Recommendation:</strong> SHORT, Entry: 2700.00, Stop Loss: 2715.00</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Use This:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Read Each File:</strong> For each file you listed (e.g., <code>response/AAPL.md</code>, <code>response/TSLA.md</code>), open and read the content.</li>
<li><strong>Extract Data:</strong> Find the asset name, the trading recommendation (SHORT or LONG), the entry price, the stop loss, and the take profit probability from the report.</li>
<li><strong>Populate the Template:</strong> Fill in the bracketed placeholders in the template above with the data you extracted.</li>
<li><strong>Sort:</strong> Once you’ve filled in the template for all reports, sort the lines from lowest to highest probability.</li>
<li><strong>Present:</strong> Present the sorted list.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Considerations and Error Message Explained</strong></p>
<p>The error message <code>&quot;tail: cannot open &#39;response/*&#39; for reading: No such file or directory&quot;</code> indicates that the <code>tail</code> command (which I assume you or some script used) couldn’t find a directory named “response” in the location where the command was run or the files inside. That means you may have the following errors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorrect Path:</strong> The <code>response</code> directory might not exist <em>in the directory where you’re running the command</em>. Double-check the path. It might need to be a relative path (e.g., <code>./response/AAPL.md</code> if the <code>response</code> directory is in the current directory) or an absolute path (e.g., <code>/home/user/trading_bot/response/AAPL.md</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Typo:</strong> There may be a typo in the directory or file names.</li>
<li><strong>Missing Files:</strong> The files might not have been created or saved to the <code>response</code> directory.</li>
<li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You might not have read permissions to the <code>response</code> directory or the files within it.</li>
<li><strong>Globbing Issue:</strong> If you used wildcard <code>*</code> characters and no files matched that pattern, you may get that error.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fix the error, ensure the <code>response</code> directory and the <code>.md</code> files actually exist in the location you expect, that the path is correct, and that you have permissions to read them.</p>
<p>Once you can access and read the files, you can follow the template above to organize the information. Let me know if you have sample content from one of the files, and I can give you a more precise example.</p>
