<p>Please note that these probability assessments are highly subjective and based on the limited data provided in the reports. They should not be used as the sole basis for making trading decisions. It is essential to consider other factors, conduct thorough research, and consult with a financial advisor before making any trades.</p>
<p>One important thing to note is that probability changes dramatically with more data and can be vastly different when trading.</p>
