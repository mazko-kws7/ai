<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to any files and the command <code>tail</code> returned an error (because the directory doesn’t exist), I’ll provide a template response of how I <em>would</em> process the reports and summarize them, sorted by profit probability, if I had the data.</p>
<p><strong>Template Response (Assuming I Had Access to <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files):</strong></p>
<p>“Okay, I will provide a summary of each report, sorted by take profit probability. I will use the place holder values for all the reports to simulate output. After you will have a correct files, let me know to reprocess the data.”</p>
<pre><code>Here&#39;s a summary of the trading position recommendations, sorted by take profit probability:

*   **Asset: [Asset Name 4], Probability: [95%]:** [Brief summary of recommendation, e.g., LONG, entry price [entry price value] , stop loss [stop loss value] ].
*   **Asset: [Asset Name 2], Probability: [80%]:** [Brief summary of recommendation, e.g., SHORT, entry price [entry price value], stop loss [stop loss value] ].
*   **Asset: [Asset Name 1], Probability: [70%]:** [Brief summary of recommendation, e.g., LONG, entry price [entry price value], stop loss [stop loss value] ].
*   **Asset: [Asset Name 3], Probability: [60%]:** [Brief summary of recommendation, e.g., SHORT, entry price [entry price value], stop loss [stop loss value] ].
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation of the Template:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Asset Name:</strong> This would be extracted from the filename (e.g., <code>response/AAPL.md</code> would yield <code>AAPL</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Probability:</strong> This value would be parsed from the content of the <code>*.md</code> file.</li>
<li><strong>Brief Summary:</strong> I would look for keywords like “LONG,” “SHORT,” “Entry Price,” and “Stop Loss” within the file’s content and extract those values.</li>
<li><strong>Sorting:</strong> The entire list would be sorted in <em>descending</em> order based on the probability value.</li>
<li><strong>Place holder values</strong>: Added example values and [] marks to make it clear to the user which values will be used to process the data.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Considerations When You Provide Actual Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Format:</strong> I’m assuming the <code>*.md</code> files are plain text or Markdown. If they are in a different format (e.g., JSON, CSV), let me know, and I’ll adjust the parsing logic.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Tell me the exact keywords used in the reports to identify “LONG,” “SHORT,” “Entry Price,” “Stop Loss,” and “Probability.” This is crucial for accurate extraction.</li>
<li><strong>Data Consistency:</strong> I’m assuming the reports are structured consistently. If the format varies significantly between reports, the parsing may be less reliable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you provide the actual file content, I can give you a real, accurate, and sorted summary.</p>
