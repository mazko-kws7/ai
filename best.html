<p>This list is sorted by the take profit probability, starting with the highest sell probability and ending with the lowest buy probability, listing the buy and sell signals separately. <strong>Clarification:</strong> I have tried my best to create the final sorted list based on the probabilities as extracted from the files provided, however: 1. Several have confidence level as <code>Medium</code>, this can impact the final ordering since all the different signals could be completely interchangeable if two or more signals have the exact same take profit probability. 2. Several of the files show both, a sell and buy signals, sometimes with the same confidence level, I’ve tried my best to put them on the correct place. 3. If there are any inconsistencies with the data or the ordering, please let me know and I’ll correct them. 4. If you have more files to analize let me know and I’ll update my response. 5. I’ve extracted as much data as posible from the data that was provided, I hope it’s helpfull.</p>
