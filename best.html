</ul>
<h2 id="bgb-usd"><a href="./BGB-USD.html">BGB-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>BGB has recently decreased, which coupled with a bearish divergence suggests a potential short term downtrend</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fil-usd"><a href="./FIL-USD.html">FIL-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>Several sources indicate strong sell signals based on technical indicators such as moving averages and oscillators. The daily chart you provided also shows some downward movement recently. Barchart Technical Opinion rating is an 80% Sell.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>

<h2 id="ftn-usd"><a href="./FTN-USD.html">FTN-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>If FTN-USD fails to break above $4.45 and the RSI indicates overbought conditions, a short-term sell signal could be considered.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>
<li>Resistance around 21.32 and uncertain market conditions suggest potential for a pullback. News suggest escalating trade tensions are impacting the broader crypto market, so this negative factor might outweigh any potential bullish signals.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>
<li>If the price fails to break above the resistance level of $23.50 and technical indicators start showing bearish signals (e.g., bearish divergence in MACD on shorter timeframes), a sell signal could be considered.

<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>
