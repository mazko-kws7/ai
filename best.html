<pre class="csv"><code>Asset Name|Position Type|Probability|Recommendation
ACT-USD|Sell|85|Strong downward trend across both daily and hourly charts. General cryptocurrency market growth is not reflected in ACT-USD. High recent volatility and a recent large price drop.
ATOM-USD|Sell|90|The price failed to break recent high, MACD showing convergence
AAVE-USD|Sell|90|The AAVE price is approaching a critical resistance zone around 173.04 USDT—a decisive area for potential breakout or rejection.
GT-USD|Sell|90|If GT-USD fails to break above $23.50 and shows signs of weakness (e.g., bearish candlestick patterns), it might be a good time to take profits or reduce holdings. The daily chart shows resistance around this level.
ETH-USD|Sell|75|The daily chart indicates an overall downtrend. The recent price consolidation might be a temporary retracement before another leg down. Also, as mentioned before, bearish divergence in the MACD is an indicator for selling.
ARB-USD|Sell|75|The daily chart shows a clear downtrend, and the price is struggling to break past the $0.35 resistance level.
ADA-USD|Sell|75|Price hitting resistance level of $0.74, ADX is at 69.32, suggesting a strong trend, and the Parabolic SAR is at 0.66928, indicating a potential reversal point.
EOS-USD|Sell|75|Despite the short-term bullish signals, EOS has struggled to maintain upward momentum historically. Technical analysis shows mixed signals. The longer-term chart shows significant volatility.
CFX-USD|Sell|75|If the price breaks down below $0.070, it would confirm the bearish trend, and a sell position could be considered.
AVAX-USD|Sell|80|Hourly chart shows consolidation around $22, but the 4-hour RSI indicates overbought conditions. The overall market sentiment is showing a shift from bearish sentiment.
DEXE-USD|Sell / Hold|80|Downtrend, price below moving averages, and negative market sentiment (flash crash news).
BGB-USD|Sell|80|The mid-term trend (last 3 months) is still downward. The price is below key moving averages on the daily chart (not provided, but implied by the downtrend). If you are already in a position, consider tightening stop losses.
ENA-USD|Sell/Reduce Holdings|80|The dominant long-term trend is bearish. Until there&#39;s a confirmed trend reversal, selling into any rallies is a reasonable strategy. The &quot;depression&quot; sentiment in altcoins supports this view.
BCH-USD|Sell|65|High volatility and uncertainty in the market. The price may face resistance at higher levels, prompting a potential short-term sell.
FIL-USD|Sell|75|The daily chart shows a clear downtrend over the past three months. The recent stabilization could be a temporary pause before further declines.
ALGO-USD|Sell|60|The long-term daily chart trend suggests a downtrend is in place. While there is short-term consolidation, a bounce to previous levels of resistance is not likely, suggesting selling into rallies may be a viable strategy. A weak bounce suggests a continuation of the downtrend.
APT-USD|Sell|80|The daily chart shows a downtrend, and the proposal to reduce staking rewards could negatively impact the price. Short-term technicals are mixed, but overall sentiment is cautious.
BNB-USD|Sell|60|Hourly chart shows consolidation; a break below support could lead to downward momentum. Overall market sentiment is mixed.
BTC-USD|Sell|80|Recent daily chart shows a downtrend, and hourly chart indicates consolidation around a resistance level.
CRO-USD|Sell|55|The Trump Media–Crypto.com ETF partnership didn&#39;t sustain momentum and the price of CRO dropped.
DOT-USD|Sell|75|The long-term trend from the daily chart suggests a downward movement. SEC&#39;s ETF decision delay might add to the bearish sentiment.
FET-USD|Sell|65|The overall trend on the daily chart is still bearish. Failure to break above the $0.79 resistance could lead to a further decline. Technical analysis from one source suggests a &quot;strong sell&quot; signal.
ETC-USD|Sell|80|ETC-USD is showing signs of downward momentum on the daily chart, trading near the bottom of its recent range. The hourly chart does not show a strong upward trend, and volume is generally low. The current price is below where it was three months ago and one year ago.
HBAR-USD|Sell|75|The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart is approaching overbought territory, hinting at a potential pullback. HBAR completes a five-wave impulse inside a rising wedge. Despite the price rise, a bearish outlook is the primary one.
HYPE-USD|Sell / Hold|80|Downtrend, price below moving averages, and negative market sentiment (flash crash news).
IMX-USD|Sell|75|RSI might indicate overbought condition. Hourly charts show low volume meaning the high prices are unsustainable
INJ-USD|Sell|65|Overall downtrend remains in place. Recent consolidation could be a temporary pause before further declines.
JUP-USD|Sell|80|Downtrend in the daily chart. The hourly chart shows consolidation, indicating that the price is likely to continue downward.
KAS-USD|Sell|85|If holding KAS from lower levels, consider selling a portion of your holdings to secure profits, given the recent price increase and potential for short-term volatility.
LDO-USD|Sell/Reduce Holdings|80|The dominant long-term trend is bearish. Until there&#39;s a confirmed trend reversal, selling into any rallies is a reasonable strategy. The &quot;depression&quot; sentiment in altcoins supports this view.
LEO-USD|Sell|80|Price hitting resistance, bearish divergence suggests weakening momentum. Negative regulatory news adds to downside risk.
LINK-USD|Sell|60|Failure to break the resistance level on the hourly chart, combined with broader market volatility, could lead to a downward move. The price has struggled to maintain upward momentum.
LTC-USD|Sell|55|If LTC-USD fails to break above the $88 resistance level on the hourly chart and begins to show downward momentum, it could indicate a potential short-term sell opportunity.
NEAR-USD|Sell|80|The price has been in a downtrend. If NEAR fails to break above the $2.80 level and shows signs of further decline, a sell signal could be considered.
NEIRO-USD|Sell|70|Price hitting channel&#39;s resistance, which could signal a pullback toward the channel&#39;s lower trendline.
ONDO-USD|Sell|60|If ONDO fails to sustain above $0.98 and breaks below support at $0.81, or if negative news impacts the broader crypto market, a sell signal might be warranted.
OP-USD|Sell|65|The daily chart shows a clear downtrend. If the price fails to break above the 1.15 resistance level and starts declining, it could signal a continuation of the downtrend.
PEPE-USD|Sell|65|The overall daily trend is downward.
POL-USD|Sell|80|If GT-USD fails to break above $23.50 and shows signs of weakness (e.g., bearish candlestick patterns), it might be a good time to take profits or reduce holdings. The daily chart shows resistance around this level.
RAY-USD|Sell|80|Recent price surge might be overbought, with the daily chart still indicating a downtrend. A recent article from 2025-04-28 suggests that a correction may follow.
SHIB-USD|Sell|80|Technical analysis on Investing.com show strong sell signals. Overall downtrend in the last three months, coupled with recent consolidation, suggests limited upside potential. Risk of further decline if broader market sentiment turns bearish.
SOL-USD|Sell|80|RSI might indicate overbought condition. Hourly charts show low volume meaning the high prices are unsustainable
STX-USD|Sell|75|The overall trend on the daily chart is bearish. Any short-term rallies may be followed by further declines.
ENA-USD|Buy|60|Based on news from late April indicating a potential bullish phase, there is a possibility of an upward move. However, the overall downtrend and low trading volume add considerable risk.
FTN-USD|Sell|80|The Fear and Greed index indicates that the crypto market may be overvalued, which could lead to a correction.
DOGE-USD|Sell|60|Failure to break the resistance level on the hourly chart, combined with broader market volatility, could lead to a downward move. The price has struggled to maintain upward momentum.
ATOM-USD|Buy|65|The price has recently bounced off a support level, and the RSI is not yet in overbought territory. There&#39;s positive news regarding Cosmos&#39;s interoperability efforts. The 50 day SMA is showing upward trend
ADA-USD|Buy|65|ADA has broken out of a descending wedge pattern with bullish sentiment around ADA remaining strikingly bullish. ADA is working to confirm the $0.71 zone as weekly support, a move that could quietly set the stage for the next leg higher.
AVAX-USD|Buy|65|A bullish trend reversal is potentially underway as it approaches a demand zone of 14.50. The daily RSI indicates rising momentum.
ALGO-USD|Buy|30|The price has fallen significantly and is consolidating. A small speculative long position with a tight stop-loss might be warranted, anticipating a short-term bounce.
AAVE-USD|Buy|65|AAVE has shown solid bullish momentum after reclaiming key levels. The price action carves out a strong uptrend supported by consistent volume growth, signaling buyer dominance.
APT-USD|Buy|60|Aptos is showing positive momentum due to the Expo 2025 announcement. It has support around $5.40. Positive technical indicators and rising on-chain activity suggest a potential rebound.
IMX-USD|Buy|60|Recent positive news flow, including user growth and partnerships, combined with the break above the falling wedge pattern, suggests bullish momentum. However, overbought conditions warrant caution. The daily chart is showing downtrend, but hourly is moving sideways.
ETH-USD|Buy|60|The hourly chart shows some signs of short-term upward movement. The price is currently hovering around $1790-1810, with some volatility. If it can break the resistance at $1815 and $1825, it might provide a quick profit opportunity.
HBAR-USD|Buy|60|Hedera Hashgraph&#39;s token may be on the verge of a strong bullish breakout after forming a giant falling wedge pattern. Hedera has integrated with Tokeny Solutions, enabling institutions to bring assets onto the Hedera network.
DEXE-USD|Buy|60|A small buy position could be considered if the price breaks above the $0.083 resistance level, with a tight stop-loss. Recent news of IMF incorporating crypto into global economic data.
LTC-USD|Buy|60|The hourly chart shows some stabilization around $600-$608 level. If BNB-USD breaks above $608 with significant volume, it could signal a bullish breakout.
BTC-USD|Buy|60|Price has pulled back significantly on the daily chart, approaching potential support levels. A positive news event (e.g., institutional adoption) could trigger a bounce.
CFX-USD|Buy|60|A small buy position could be considered if the price breaks above the $0.083 resistance level, with a tight stop-loss. Recent news of IMF incorporating crypto into global economic data.
CRO-USD|Buy|60|The daily chart shows signs of recovery after a significant downtrend, with a potential for upward movement. Additionally, market analysis anticipates a positive trend for Cronos in July.
FET-USD|Buy|55|The price has pulled back significantly over the last three months and is currently consolidating around $0.71. News of the ASI merger and potential token burns could provide some upward momentum. A break above the $0.79 resistance on the hourly chart could signal a potential short-term rally.
DOT-USD|Buy|60|DOT shows some upwards potential. A key support lies at $4.10, and buyers are actively defending this level, making it a strong base for a potential rebound.
ENA-USD|Hold|50|The short-term trend is unclear. The hourly chart shows range-bound trading, but there&#39;s no strong indication of a breakout in either direction. The mixed news sentiment adds to the uncertainty.

PEPE-USD|Buy|40|Potential short-term bounce based on hourly chart fluctuations.

GT-USD|Buy|60|Recent dip on the hourly chart suggests a possible short-term buying opportunity. The price has recovered from the dip, indicating potential support.
INJ-USD|Buy|30|Price has corrected significantly, approaching potential support levels. If RSI indicates oversold conditions on the daily chart.

Near|Buy|60|Recent price consolidation and mixed market signals. The SEC postponing the decision on Polkadot ETFs creates uncertainty.
ONDO-USD|Buy|65|Recent bullish momentum, engagement with SEC showing potential regulatory compliance, positive news flow, and short-term upward trend in hourly chart.

IMX-USD|Hold|50|Given the conflicting signals, the price may continue to consolidate within the current range. A wait-and-see approach might be prudent.
SHIB-USD|Hold|50|The GT-USD is currently showing a very neutral signal with a probability of 50%. This is due to a mixture of positive and negative feedback. There are potential upsides in the approval of ETF&#39;s as well as general sentiments surrounding cryptocurrency, but there are also possible downsides in the climate impact, regulation and US trade tariffs.
