<p>Okay, here’s the formatted output based on the analysis of all the provided reports, sorted by take profit probability in descending order:</p>

<h2 id="ena-usd"><a href="./ENA-USD.html">ENA-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>
<li>Consistent downtrend on the daily chart, resistance around $0.32, and a potential retest of lower support levels. The hourly chart shows bearish pressure and recent token unlock on May 5th may trigger selling pressure.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sell 65%</li>
