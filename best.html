<p>Okay, I understand. Since you are getting a “No such file or directory” error, it means I cannot directly access and read the files you are referencing.</p>
<p><strong>However, based on your instructions, I can provide the <em>format</em> of the output I would give you <em>if</em> I could access the files.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Desired Output Format:</strong></p>
<p>Assuming I could read the files “response/ASSET_NAME.md”, I would process each one and generate a summary like this, sorted by profit probability (highest to lowest):</p>
<pre><code>Asset: [ASSET_NAME_1], Probability: [PROBABILITY_1]
Asset: [ASSET_NAME_2], Probability: [PROBABILITY_2]
Asset: [ASSET_NAME_3], Probability: [PROBABILITY_3]
...etc...</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example (If I had data):</strong></p>
<p>Let’s <em>pretend</em> I read the following data from these example files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>response/AAPL.md</code>: Recommendation: LONG, Entry: 170, Stop: 165, Probability: 0.75</li>
<li><code>response/TSLA.md</code>: Recommendation: SHORT, Entry: 1000, Stop: 1010, Probability: 0.60</li>
<li><code>response/GOOG.md</code>: Recommendation: LONG, Entry: 2500, Stop: 2480, Probability: 0.80</li>
</ul>
<p>Then my output would be:</p>
<pre><code>Asset: GOOG, Probability: 0.80
Asset: AAPL, Probability: 0.75
Asset: TSLA, Probability: 0.60</code></pre>
<p><strong>In Summary:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I would iterate through the list of <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file names.</li>
<li>For each file, I would:
<ul>
<li>Read the file content.</li>
<li>Extract the “ASSET_NAME” from the filename itself.</li>
<li>Extract the “Probability” value from the file content.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I would store the ASSET_NAME and Probability in a suitable data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries or tuples).</li>
<li>I would sort the data structure based on the Probability value in descending order (highest probability first).</li>
<li>Finally, I would print the sorted results in the format “Asset: [ASSET_NAME], Probability: [PROBABILITY]”.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To Get Actual Results:</strong></p>
<p>You need to <em>provide me</em> with the content of the files (the contents of <code>response/AAPL.md</code>, <code>response/TSLA.md</code>, etc.). You can copy and paste the contents of each file, and then I can perform the analysis and give you the sorted list of assets and probabilities. For example, you could say:</p>
<p>“Here is the content of response/AAPL.md: [paste content here] Here is the content of response/TSLA.md: [paste content here] Here is the content of response/GOOG.md: [paste content here]”</p>
<p>Then I can do the work.</p>
