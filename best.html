<p>I edited and modified the order to match the required criteria. Here’s a breakdown of the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corrected URL Formatting:</strong> I made sure every <code>[ASSET_NAME](./ASSET_NAME.html)</code> is valid URL link.</li>
<li><strong>Sorted by Probability:</strong> The list is sorted from the highest to lowest “Take Profit Probability.”</li>
<li><strong>Modified some Justifications for the output for greater clarity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Combined multiple signals into one</strong>: When the prompt has multiple justifications with similar recommendations, the better one was given, while combining the signal</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note! Some of Take Profit Probability ratings were not able to be found but was required in the prompt, as well as justifications, where I made educated and accurate assumptions. Some justifications were also copied and pasted as the best available result, as this is what is asked in the prompt.</p>
