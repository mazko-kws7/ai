<ul>
<li>Sell 75%</li>

<ul>
<li>Sell 90%</li>
<li>DOT is trading below key moving averages (20, 50, and 200-day), confirming a bearish trend. Recent news highlights a shift of projects away from the Polkadot ecosystem. The opening gap down from $4.1 to $2.931 further supports the sell signal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dot-usd-1"><a href="./DOT-USD.html">DOT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>The current price is near the upper end of today’s range, suggesting a potential technical bounce. Oscillators hint at a possible recovery, although downward momentum prevails overall. The launch of DOT staking on Coinbase in New York could provide some buying pressure. This signal is very risky and depends on short-term market fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ena-usd-1"><a href="./ENA-USD.html">ENA-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="eos-usd-1"><a href="./EOS-USD.html">EOS-USD</a></h2>

<h2 id="etc-usd"><a href="./ETC-USD.html">ETC-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 70%</li>

<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>Recent news indicates a potential bullish move, and the price is breaking above a falling wedge pattern [1]. However, consider the “Greed” sentiment and potential for market volatility [4, 9].</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="eth-usd-2"><a href="./ETH-USD.html">ETH-USD</a></h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="fet-usd"><a href="./FET-USD.html">FET-USD</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="gt-usd"><a href="./GT-USD.html">GT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sell 80%</li>
<li>The overall cryptocurrency market is experiencing a downturn due to global trade tensions. GT-USD’s recent price action on the hourly chart confirms a downward trend. Given the high correlation of altcoins with Bitcoin’s price movement during risk-off events, GT-USD is likely to decline further.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gt-usd-1"><a href="./GT-USD.html">GT-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
<li>If GT-USD experiences a significant price drop in line with or exceeding the broader market correction, and if Bitcoin shows signs of stabilization around key support levels (e.g., $100,000 as mentioned by analysts), a contrarian buy opportunity might emerge. This would be based on the expectation of a market rebound after the initial shock.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hbar-usd-1"><a href="./HBAR-USD.html">HBAR-USD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>

<ul>
<li>Buy 60%</li>
