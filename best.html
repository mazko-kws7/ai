<p>Okay, I understand. Since I don’t have access to the files or their contents (the <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files), I’ll have to create a simulated example based on your description. I will make up the data so you can understand how I would process it if I <em>did</em> have the files.</p>
<p><strong>Example Scenario &amp; Simulated Data</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say you gave me these “reports” (in reality, just the filenames, and I will <em>imagine</em> their content).</p>
<pre><code>response/AAPL.md
response/GOOGL.md
response/MSFT.md
response/TSLA.md
response/AMZN.md</code></pre>
<p>And let’s <em>pretend</em> the contents of these files are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>response/AAPL.md:</strong> <code>Recommendation: LONG, Entry: $170, Stop Loss: $165, Profit Probability: 75%</code></li>
<li><strong>response/GOOGL.md:</strong> <code>Recommendation: SHORT, Entry: $2700, Stop Loss: $2750, Profit Probability: 60%</code></li>
<li><strong>response/MSFT.md:</strong> <code>Recommendation: LONG, Entry: $300, Stop Loss: $295, Profit Probability: 80%</code></li>
<li><strong>response/TSLA.md:</strong> <code>Recommendation: SHORT, Entry: $1000, Stop Loss: $1020, Profit Probability: 50%</code></li>
<li><strong>response/AMZN.md:</strong> <code>Recommendation: LONG, Entry: $3500, Stop Loss: $3450, Profit Probability: 90%</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Desired Output (Based on Simulated Data)</strong></p>
<p>If I had access to those files, I would produce the following output:</p>
<pre><code>AMZN: 90%
MSFT: 80%
AAPL: 75%
GOOGL: 60%
TSLA: 50%</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation of the Process (that I would use if I had the files):</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>File Iteration:</strong> I would iterate through the list of filenames you provide (e.g., <code>response/AAPL.md</code>, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>File Reading (if possible):</strong> For each file, I would <em>attempt</em> to open and read its content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> I would parse the content of the file (using string manipulation or regular expressions) to extract the asset name (<code>AAPL</code>, <code>GOOGL</code>, etc.) and the “Profit Probability”. I would assume the format is consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> I would store the asset name and probability as a key-value pair in a suitable data structure (like a dictionary or a list of tuples).</li>
<li><strong>Sorting:</strong> I would sort the stored data based on the “Profit Probability” in descending order (highest probability first).</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> I would format the sorted data into the desired output format (<code>ASSET_NAME: PROBABILITY%</code>) and print it to the console.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Error Handling (Important!)</strong></p>
<p>Because the prompt included <code>tail: cannot open &#39;response/*&#39; for reading: No such file or directory</code>, a real implementation <em>must</em> include robust error handling. This would involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking if a file exists before attempting to open it.</li>
<li>Handling potential <code>IOError</code> exceptions that can occur when reading a file.</li>
<li>Handling cases where the file format is unexpected and the probability cannot be extracted. In such a case, the program should either skip the file or report an error without crashing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Caveats &amp; How to Use This Response</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I cannot actually access your files.</strong> This response is a <em>simulation</em> to show you the process.</li>
<li><strong>You need to adapt this logic to your programming language of choice.</strong> The example is conceptual.</li>
<li><strong>Provide real file contents!</strong> If you can paste the <em>actual contents</em> of a few of the <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files here, I can give you a much more specific (and even code-based) answer. This will allow me to write regular expressions that can actually extract data from your reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if you can provide example file contents!</p>
