<p>Okay, I understand. It seems like you were expecting the system to automatically process files in a directory called “response,” but that didn’t work because those files don’t exist. Since I don’t have access to external files or directories, I’ll need you to <em>provide</em> the content of each report one by one.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’ll proceed, and how you should structure your input:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>You provide the report content.</strong> You will copy and paste the <em>entire</em> content of each <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> file here into our conversation. Make sure to indicate which asset the content belongs to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I’ll extract the relevant data.</strong> I will look for the following information within the content you provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Name:</strong> I’ll extract this from the name you give me initially (e.g., when you say “Report for response/AAPL.md:”).</li>
<li><strong>Trading Position:</strong> (SHORT or LONG)</li>
<li><strong>Entry Price:</strong> The price at which the trade is recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Stop Loss:</strong> The price at which the trade should be stopped to limit losses.</li>
<li><strong>Profit Probability:</strong> The probability of the trade being profitable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>I’ll summarize and sort.</strong> After you’ve provided all the reports, I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a short summary for each report, including the Asset Name, Trading Position, Entry Price, Stop Loss, and Profit Probability.</li>
<li>Sort the summaries by the Profit Probability in descending order (highest probability first).</li>
<li>Present the sorted summaries to you.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example Interaction:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Report for response/AAPL.md:
---
Recommendation: LONG
Entry Price: 170.00
Stop Loss: 165.00
Profit Probability: 0.75
---</code></pre>
<p><strong>You:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Report for response/GOOG.md:
---
Recommendation: SHORT
Entry Price: 2500.00
Stop Loss: 2550.00
Profit Probability: 0.60
---</code></pre>
<p><strong>You:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Report for response/TSLA.md:
---
Recommendation: LONG
Entry Price: 800.00
Stop Loss: 780.00
Profit Probability: 0.80
---</code></pre>
<p><strong>Me (after you’ve provided all reports):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Here&#39;s the summary of the reports, sorted by Profit Probability (highest to lowest):

*   **Asset: TSLA, Recommendation: LONG, Entry: 800.00, Stop Loss: 780.00, Probability: 0.80**
*   **Asset: AAPL, Recommendation: LONG, Entry: 170.00, Stop Loss: 165.00, Probability: 0.75**
*   **Asset: GOOG, Recommendation: SHORT, Entry: 2500.00, Stop Loss: 2550.00, Probability: 0.60**</code></pre>
<p><strong>Now, please provide the content of your reports, one at a time, so I can process them.</strong> Remember to start each report with “Report for response/ASSET_NAME.md:”.</p>
