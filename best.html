<strong>Notes on formatting and interpretation:</strong></li>
<li>Where there were multiple signals for the same coin, I included each signal as a separate item, since each item refers to a <em>different</em> trading recommendation/strategy.</li>
<li>Take Profit Probabilities where take profit = N/A were sorted to the end.</li>
<li>“Take profit probability” values were used to sort the list where provided. If multiple values were given, the first was used.</li>
<li>I had to infer the asset name for some ‘hold’ signals where it was not repeated.</li>
<li>I assumed that all links were to <code>.html</code> pages as requested in your instructions.</li>
<li>I left out “neutral” signals, as these did not ask for a buy or sell signal. Please specify in the prompt if these should be added.</li>
