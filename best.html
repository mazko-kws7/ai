<p>Okay, I understand. You’re giving me a list of filenames, each representing a trading report for a specific asset. Each report file contains a trading position (SHORT or LONG), entry price, stop loss, and profit probability. I need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Extract the Asset Name:</strong> From the filename <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Extract the Profit Probability:</strong> This information is inside the file content, which you are <em>not</em> providing directly. I will <em>assume</em> I can get this later and represent this field as <code>PROBABILITY</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Summary:</strong> A short summary containing the Asset Name and Profit Probability.</li>
<li><strong>Sort by Probability:</strong> Sort the summaries in ascending order of profit probability (lowest to highest).</li>
<li><strong>Deal with the Error Message:</strong> I will ignore the <code>tail</code> error, as it is not relevant to my role of processing file contents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since you’re not providing the <em>content</em> of the files, I will assume you will provide it to me later.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how I’ll structure my response (which is currently incomplete since I have no probabilities):</strong></p>
<p>I will provide the list of asset names and wait for probabilities.</p>
<pre><code>Asset Names detected:
ASSET_NAME</code></pre>
<p><strong>When you provide the information from the files, I will update the summary to something like this:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Sorted Trading Recommendations (by Probability):

ASSET_NAME_1: PROBABILITY_1%
ASSET_NAME_2: PROBABILITY_2%
...
ASSET_NAME_N: PROBABILITY_N%
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example (if you had provided content):</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say you later told me:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>response/AAPL.md</code> contains (among other things) “Profit Probability: 65%”</li>
<li><code>response/GOOG.md</code> contains (among other things) “Profit Probability: 70%”</li>
<li><code>response/MSFT.md</code> contains (among other things) “Profit Probability: 60%”</li>
</ul>
<p>My final response would be:</p>
<pre><code>Sorted Trading Recommendations (by Probability):

MSFT: 60%
AAPL: 65%
GOOG: 70%</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Format of Probability:</strong> You need to tell me <em>exactly</em> how the “Profit Probability” is formatted inside the files (e.g., <code>&quot;Profit Probability: 75%&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;probability: 0.75&quot;</code>). This is crucial for me to extract it correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling (File Content):</strong> I’m assuming the files always exist and contain the profit probability information. If this is not the case, tell me how I should handle missing files or files without probability information (e.g., skip them, report an error).</li>
<li><strong>Order of Responses:</strong> Since I need to <em>sort</em> by probability, I will need to collect all the asset names and probabilities <em>first</em> before I can provide the final sorted list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now, please provide the content for each of the <code>response/ASSET_NAME.md</code> files, one by one, so I can give you the sorted recommendations.</strong></p>
