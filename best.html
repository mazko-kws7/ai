<p>Okay, I understand. Since you didn’t provide any actual report content, I’ll create a placeholder response that demonstrates how I would process and summarize the information if you <em>did</em> provide the reports. I’ll assume a few report files exist with the names following the pattern you specified.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the placeholder response:</strong></p>
<p>(Assuming the following files exist and contain some data: <code>response/AAPL.md</code>, <code>response/GOOG.md</code>, <code>response/MSFT.md</code>, <code>response/TSLA.md</code>)</p>
<p><strong>Report Summary (Sorted by Take Profit Probability):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset: MSFT, Probability: 65%</strong> - Summary would include the core recommendation (e.g., “LONG”), entry price, and stop loss from the MSFT report if available.</li>
<li><strong>Asset: TSLA, Probability: 70%</strong> - Summary would include the core recommendation (e.g., “SHORT”), entry price, and stop loss from the TSLA report if available.</li>
<li><strong>Asset: GOOG, Probability: 75%</strong> - Summary would include the core recommendation (e.g., “LONG”), entry price, and stop loss from the GOOG report if available.</li>
<li><strong>Asset: AAPL, Probability: 80%</strong> - Summary would include the core recommendation (e.g., “SHORT”), entry price, and stop loss from the AAPL report if available.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation of the Response and What I Would Do With Actual Data:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>File Processing:</strong> I would read each file matching the pattern <code>response/*.md</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> For each file:
<ul>
<li>I would extract the asset name from the filename (e.g., <code>AAPL</code> from <code>response/AAPL.md</code>).</li>
<li>I would <em>parse the file content</em> to find the trading position (LONG/SHORT), entry price, stop loss, and profit probability. <strong>This is the key part where I need the <em>actual content</em> of the files.</strong> I would assume a consistent format for these values in your reports. For example, I might look for lines like: <code>Recommendation: LONG     Entry Price: 150.25     Stop Loss: 148.00     Profit Probability: 75%</code> or some other structured format. The more consistent the format, the more reliably I can extract the information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Summary Creation:</strong> I would create a summary string for each asset, including:
<ul>
<li>Asset Name</li>
<li>Probability</li>
<li>Recommendation (LONG/SHORT)</li>
<li>Entry Price</li>
<li>Stop Loss</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sorting:</strong> I would sort the summaries in ascending order based on the profit probability.</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> I would present the sorted summaries in a clear, readable format.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To get a <em>real</em> response, please provide the content of the <code>response/*.md</code> files (or example content that represents the format of those files).</strong> The more detail you provide about the file format, the better I can tailor the extraction and summary process.</p>
